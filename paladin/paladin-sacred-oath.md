## Sacred Oath
When you reach 2nd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- these changes are a part of a paradigm shift
- class level-ups are being syncronized more
- in spite of feature displacement, the structure feels worth it
- the extra subclass levels could be replaced with dead levels or ribbons
- this particular class now has a huge number of subclass stuff
- level 2 and 5 are spin up levels, more or less
