## Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Starting at 8th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to repel undead entities.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censure the undead.
Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it is *frightened* for 5 minutes or until it faces a malevolent action.

While *frightened*, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
It also can't take reactions.
For its action, it can use only the *dash* action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the *dodge* action.
