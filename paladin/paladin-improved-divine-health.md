## Improved Divine Health
At 20th level, the blood in your veins course with pure divine energy. You are immune to poison.

Even as you lay dead, your body is filled with a righteous passion. Your body will not decay, and is perserved perfectly through the echos of time. You cannot become undead, and a spellcaster ignores any time limits when trying to bring you back to life.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- paladin deserves a wonderful fluff ability at 20th level

-<< TODO >>-
- TODO: reword and rethink, this ability is sort of badly made

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the wording here is pretty terrible
- the ability needs a a rework
- this ability should pretty much just be a nice ribbon to tie everything together
- the true power from level 20 paladin comes from the subclass
