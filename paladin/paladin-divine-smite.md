## Divine Smite
Beginning at 3rd level, your sacred oath grants you the ability to suffuse your melee weapons with divine power. Once per turn, when you make a melee weapon attack, you can declare your divine intention to smite your target and expend a spell slot to charge your weapon. 

If the attack misses, you regain your spent spell slot, and you are permitted to use this feature again on this turn. If the attack hits, it deals radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st. The damage increases by an extra 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a Fiend.
