## Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds.
You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest.
With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to `your paladin level Ã— 5`.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
