## Bearer of Burdens
By 19th level, you have hardened your will against all but the most painful attacks. You gain a damage threshold of 10 while you are wearing heavy armor. Whenever you take 10 or less damage, you instead take 0 damage.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- first ability to have a damage threshold here.
- heavily encourages heavy armor

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- damage threshold is pretty cool! including it here is a fun idea.
- plays into damage reduction as well pretty nicely.
- paladin needed a fun 19th level ability to keep them going to 20th.
