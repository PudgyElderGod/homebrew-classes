## Lay on Hands: Cleansing Touch
Starting at 14th level, you can end magical effects on other creatures.
When you use your Lay on Hands, you can expend `20` hit points from your pool of healing to end one spell or lift one curse affecting it.
You can end multiple spells and lift multiple curses with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points seperately for each one.
