## Aura of Protection
Starting at 5th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 17th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
