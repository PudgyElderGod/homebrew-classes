## Aura of Protection
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain a bonus `+1d4` to saving throws while you are conscious.

At 19th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved base from 6th level to 7th
- moved improvements from 18th level to 19th
- lowered bonus to just +1d4 instead of full CHA

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- spell levels are gained one level later
- that displaced auras, which are gained a bit later now
- paladins were giving +5 to saves from this which is too powerful
-> this is especially considering the buffs given with their spells
-> considering bounded accuracy, this shouldn't be a thing
