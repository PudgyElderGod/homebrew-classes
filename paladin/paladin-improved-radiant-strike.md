## Improved Radiant Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them.
Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra `1d8` radiant damage.

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- paladin deserves a wonderful fluff ability at 20th level

-<< TODO >>-
- TODO: reword and rethink, this ability is sort of badly made

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the wording here is pretty terrible
- the ability needs a a rework
- this ability should pretty much just be a nice ribbon to tie everything together
- the true power from level 20 paladin comes from the subclass
