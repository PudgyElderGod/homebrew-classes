## Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine enery from your sacred oath to fuel magical effects.
You start with two such effects, determined by your sacred oath.
You will gain additional effects as you advance in paladin levels, as noted in the class description.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
The DC for such effects from this class equals your paladin spell save DC.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Beginning at 20th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests.
When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved subclass channel divinity up one levels
- added 'malevolent action' to turn undead rather than being damaged.

-<< TODO >>-
- compare wording to PHB - get it close to verbatim

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- moving things around was very difficult to make it consistant with paladin.
- cleric gains this same channel divinity option.
