## Searing Smite
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to burst into flames, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw or be immolated. As a bonus action, the target can repeat this Constitution saving throw to end the condition. A creature has advantage on this saving throw if it is prone. When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

***Immolated***
- An immolated creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the beginning of each of its turns.
- An immolated creature continues to burn until it submerges itself in water and thereby ends the condition.
- An affected creature automatically fails Dexterity ability checks.
- An affected creature has half speed.
