## Thunderous Smite
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon rings with thunder that is clearly audible within 300 feet of it, and the attack deals an extra 3d4 thunder damage to the target and pummels it backward, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature of a large size or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone. When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).
