## Divine Smite
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon discharges a righteous light that is clearly  visible within 300 feet of it, and the attack deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target, then the spell ends. The extra damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or fiend. When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
