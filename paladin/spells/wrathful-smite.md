## Wrathful Smite
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon becomes a conduit for thought-altering energies, and the attack deals an extra 1d10 psychic damage to the target as it rends the mind, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. As an action, the creature can repeat this Wisdom saving throw to end the condition, steeling its resolve against you. When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).
