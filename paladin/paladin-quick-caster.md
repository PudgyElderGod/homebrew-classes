## Quick Caster
At 7th level, you can take two bonus actions on your turn. This increases to three bonus actions by 15th level.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- allows multiple bonus actions

-<< TODO >>-
- poorly worded
- too simple
- needs a better name, its a misnomer (more than casting)
- needs more fluff
- not playtested

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- quick caster is meant to open up more divine smites for extra attack
- the other benefits it could determine (eg more bonus actions for cantrips) are acceptable
-> this is because of the heavy investment in paladin to get this far
