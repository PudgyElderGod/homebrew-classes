## Divine Concentration
Starting at 3rd level, you can concentrate on up to three paladin spells at a time.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- removed divine smite(!)
- divine smite is now a spell
- this is a new ability at 3rd level
- opens up many paladin playstyles

-<< TODO >>-
- rename ability to something better

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- notice that this only works with paladin spells
- allows paladin to focus on more than just smites
- the first two concentration slots are your usual divine smite + thunderous smite
- the third concentration slot opens it up to many others - searing smite, divine favor, etc
- on other spellcasters this would be far too powerful
- consider the nerf that divine smite is now a spell, this makes sense.
- action economy becomes that much more important for paladin
