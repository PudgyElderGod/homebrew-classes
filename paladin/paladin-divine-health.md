## Divine Health
At 10th level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved up to 1st level
- removed divine sense; is now a cantrip

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- diseases for paladin even at level 1 are moot
- lay on hands immunizes the paladin in vanilla
- moving this here and removing lay on hands frees up slots for key class features
- divine sense was a spell effect anyway
