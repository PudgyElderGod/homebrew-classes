## Fighting Style
At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options.
You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Archery
You gain a `+2` nonmagical bonus to Ranged Weapon Attack Rolls.

### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a `+1` bonus to AC.

### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, the critical hit multiplier for your Melee Weapon Attacks is increased by one.
The weapon cannot have the heavy or two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.

### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll any number of the weapon's damage dice, but you must use the new rolls.
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
You gain a `+2` nonmagical bonus to damage dealt by light weapons while you are holding a weapon in each hand.
Neither weapon can have the heavy or two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- archery
-> changed to allow thrown weapons
- dueling
-> focuses on crit builds with lesser weapons than great weapons
-> encourages the use of magic and/or shields in a different hand
- great weapon fighting
-> greataxes work just as well as greatswords! -0.05 less damage
-> still favors greatswords, allows rerolls on 3's
-> viable for greataxes now, allows rerolls on 6's
- two-weapon fighting revamped
-> takes the static bonus from dueling.
-> considered granting advantage but it was too strong.
-> changed to allow thrown weapons

-<< TODO >>-
- add other UA XGE etc proper fighting styles

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- defense
-> simple and strong as it was.
- action surge 2 and extra attack 3 have been swapped
- this gives martial multiclasses more oomph, and gives fighter itself more consistant power a bit earlier
- multiclass spellcasters get less benefit from this, intentionally (they get enough goodies)
