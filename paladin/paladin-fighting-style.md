## Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

### Archery
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with ranged weapons.

### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling
When you are wielding a single medium-sized melee weapon, your critical hits with that weapon do thrice the damage dice and modifiers instead of twice. The weapon must not have the heavy or two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.

### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can choose to reroll any number of the damage dice; but you must use the new rolls. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use a reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack. You must be using a shield to gain this option.

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to interpose yourself and recieve the attack instead. You swap locations with your ally, and you impose disadvantage on the incoming attack roll. You must be using a shield to gain this option.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you don't expend your bonus action to provision your offhand strikes.
