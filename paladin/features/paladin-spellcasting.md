## Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
You have an innate knowledge of every spell on the paladin spell list, however you must prepare them before you are able to cast them.

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. Your spellcasting ability will influence the maximum number of spells you can prepare. Each spell must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Paladin table.

`Max. prepared spells = (your paladin level + your Charisma modifier) รท 2`

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
