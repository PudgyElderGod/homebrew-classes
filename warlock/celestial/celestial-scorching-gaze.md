## Scorching Gaze
You gain the ability to scorn creatures nearby by casting an impassioned glare upon them.
When a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, you can deal `2d6` radiant damage to them (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the end of your next turn.
