&dagger;*Boon of Blood gives the celestial more endurance, replacing the original 10th-level ability.*
*However it may not be the most thematic, and it might be changed later to a different invocation.*

&Dagger;*Joyous Artisan is a fluff ability to offset strengths gained earlier in this subclass, such as healing abilities and a double-dipped 6th-level subclass feature.*
*That said, it may not be the most thematic, and it might be changed later.*
