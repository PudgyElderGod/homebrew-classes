### Eldritch Secrets
- **Prerequisite:** Pact of the Tome feature

You learn two spells of your choice from any class.
A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Warlock table.
The chosen spell counts as a warlock spell for you but doesn't count against the number of warlock spells you know.
