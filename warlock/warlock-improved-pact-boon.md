## Pact Boon
At 19th level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.
You gain one of the following features of your choice.

### Improved Pact of the Blade
Whenever you land a critical hit with a weapon, you can immediately make another Weapon Attack with the same weapon.

### Improved Pact of the Chain
Your familiar gains several benefits.
- it can allocate four Ability Score increases to its various stats
- it gains the 'action surge' feature

### Improved Pact of the Tome
When you gain this feature, choose two spells of any level from any class's spell list to add to your book of shadows.
While your book is on your person, you can cast those spells.
They don't count against your number of spells known.
If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- its trying to emphasize your pact
- filling in a dead level
- as a level 19 ability, it should fill in for an arcana increase or similar

-<< TODO >>-
- QC passes needed
-> this is an alpha ability
- review and revise

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this ability was quickly put together as a placeholder for something greater
- the pact boon is touched but once or twice (via invocations) with vanilla
- this gives an ultimate ability at level 19, preferably something stupid good (simple yet powerful)
