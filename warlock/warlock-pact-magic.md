## Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma Modifier when setting the Saving Throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma Modifier`

`Spell Attack Modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma Modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells.
If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
You also regain expended all spell slots of 5th level or lower after a short rest.

### Spells Known
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows how many warlock spells you know, and how many you learn when you level up.
You must choose these spells from the warlock spell list.
Each of these spells must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Warlock table.

### Preparing Spells
The warlock spells that you know are always considered prepared to cast.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

### Patron Spells
When you choose an otherworldy patron, you gain a list of spells &mdash; called patron spells &mdash; that you gain at the warlock levels noted in the patron description.
Once you gain a patron spell, you know it, and it doesn't count against the number of spells that you can know.

If you have a patron spell that doesn't appear on the warlock spell list, the spell is nonetheless a warlock spell for you.
