## Eldritch Abomination
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to channel their true power through you.
You can spend 5 minutes pleading for aid to transform into a powerful creature.
Your transformation lasts for 5 minutes before you return to your original form and become **unconscious**.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Discuss with your DM what creature you can turn into whenever you invoke this feature.
Once you come to an agreement, the creature you chose cannot be changed.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- duration extended from 5 minutes to short rest
- impact extended to include all spell slots

-<< TODO >>-
- playtest
-> this might actually be way overpowered

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- eldritch master may have been misnamed
-> it implied you were the master of eldritch magic
-> instead, your patron overlord is the eldritch master of you
- the idea of worshipping your patron over an hour or eight is hilarious
