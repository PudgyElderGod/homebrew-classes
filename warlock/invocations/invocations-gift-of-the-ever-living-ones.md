### Gift of the Ever-Living Ones
You no longer need to eat or drink to survive, and you gain immunity to disease.

Furthermore, you have stopped aging, and can no longer die from old age.
If you appear elderly, your outward appearance begins to rewind in a sense &mdash; becoming more youthful.
For every year that you age, your elderly body seems one year younger, until finally it reaches the apparant age of a young adult
