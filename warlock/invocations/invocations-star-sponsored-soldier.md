### Star-Sponsored Soldier
You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle.
You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

As a bonus action, you can touch a suit of armor that isn't being worn or carried by anyone and instantly don it, provided you aren't wearing armor already.
Likewise, you can touch a suit of armor that you are wearing and instantly doff it.
The doffed armor appears in a desireable location within 15 feet of you, such as on an armor rack, or neatly folded into a carrying case.
