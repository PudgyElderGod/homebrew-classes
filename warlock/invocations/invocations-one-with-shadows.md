### One with Shadows
- **Prerequisite:** 5th level

You know the *invisibility* spell, and it doesn't count against the number of spells that you can know.
You can cast this spell on yourself at its lowest level without expending a spell slot, although its duration is reduced to one round (its duration expires at the end of your next turn).

<!--
