## Mystic Arcanum: Celestial
- **Prerequisite:** Celestial Patron, 5th level

You bargain with your patron for advanced magical abilities.
You uncover special spells, as shown in the table.
At 7th level, and then later at 9th level, you will have uncovered yet more spells.
These spells count as warlock spells for you, but they don't count against your number of warlock spells known.
