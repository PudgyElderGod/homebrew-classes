### Eldritch Arsenal
- **Prerequisite:** Pact of the Blade feature

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon gains a `+1` magical bonus to its Attack &amp; Damage Rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a superior bonus to those rolls.

Finally, the weapon you conjure can now be any simple, martial, or exotic weapon.

If you obtain the Supernatural Edge invocation, the magical bonus becomes `+3` instead of `+1`
