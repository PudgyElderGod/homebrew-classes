### Lifedrinker
- **Prerequisite:** 13th level, Pact of the Blade feature

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved from 12th level
- big improvements like this delayed two levels
- removed double-dip on charisma damage
-> used to use unlearned prowess + lifedrinker
-> now this keeps you well-healed in combat
-> consider that damage is cheaper than healing
