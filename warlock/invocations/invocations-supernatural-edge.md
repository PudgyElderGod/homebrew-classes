### Supernatural Edge
- **Prerequisite:** 10th level, Pact of the Blade feature

Any weapon you summon using your Pact of the Blade feature gains a `+2` magical bonus to its Attack &amp; Damage Rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a superior bonus to those rolls.

If you obtain the Eldritch Arsenal invocation, the magical bonus becomes `+3` instead of `+2`.
