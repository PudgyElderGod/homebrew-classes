## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved 19th level ASI to 20th level

-<< TODO >>-
- compare wording to PHB - get it close to verbatim

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this change has been made as apart of a paradigm shift in high level games
- 19th level abilities have been added in the ASI's wake, many of which are ribbons
-> nerfs 19/1 multiclasses by removing final ASI
- 20th level abilities have been buffed, making it feel like a truly epic tier
-> getting to a 20th level class is an achievement
-> each level-up is a temptation to multiclass
- player's are encouraged to multiclass after they reach 16th level at the latest, instead of 19th
-> this maximizes ASI's while still multiclassing
- or better yet, stick through and get that 20th level ability
