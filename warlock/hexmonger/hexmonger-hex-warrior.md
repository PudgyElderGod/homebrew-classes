## Hex Warrior
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle.
You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

Furthermore, if you land a critical hit on a target, you can forgo adding critical hit bonuses so you can mark the target for death.
When you do so, you deal the attack's normal (non-critical) damage to the target.
The next time you make an attack against that target and hit, you can choose to recall the mark's power, and deal damage to the target as if the attack was a critical hit.
The mark fades once you do so.
The mark also fades after five minutes if it has not yet been recalled.

You can only mark one target at a time with this feature.
