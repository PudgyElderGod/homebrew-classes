## Hex Warrior
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful mark on a target.
If you land a critical hit on a target, you can forgo adding a critical hit bonus and instead mark the target for death.
When you do so, you deal the attack's normal (non-critical) damage to the target.

When you make an attack against that target and hit, you can choose to recall the mark's power, and deal damage to the target as if the attack was a critical hit.

When you make an attack against that target and miss, you can choose to recall the mark's power, and turn the miss into a hit.

Whenever you recall the mark in either such ways, the mark fades.
The mark also fades after five minutes if it has not yet been recalled.
You can only mark one target at a time with this feature.
