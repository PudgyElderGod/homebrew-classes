## Spectral Apparition
Starting at 6th level, you have practiced enough with the dark magic you have been granted that you can disappear into the shadows.

You can use your action to vanish from your current plane of existence and step into the borders of the Ethereal Plane.
While you are there, you are *paralyzed*, but can choose to return to your previous plane at the beginning of a future turn of yours.

At the same time, an illusionary duplicate of you appears where you were standing in your previous plane.
It disappears if it takes any damage, and when you return from the Ethereal Plane.

You return to your previous plane after five minutes if you are still in the Border Ethereal.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
