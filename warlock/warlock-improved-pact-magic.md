## Improved Pact Magic
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to implore them use your body and spirit as a catalyst.
You can spend the duration of a short rest entreating your patron for aid.
When you do so, you turn into an aspect of your patron, utterly transforming your body in weird and terrible ways.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- duration extended from 5 minutes to short rest
- impact extended to include all spell slots

-<< TODO >>-
- playtest
-> this might actually be way overpowered

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- eldritch master may have been misnamed
-> it implied you were the master of eldritch magic
-> instead, your patron overlord is the eldritch master of you
- the idea of worshipping your patron over an hour or eight is hilarious
