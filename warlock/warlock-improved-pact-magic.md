## Improved Pact Magic
At 19th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots.
You can spend the duration of a short rest entreating your patron for aid. 
When you do so, you regain all of your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature, including those of 6th level and higher.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this used to be the capstone
- duration extended from 5 minutes to short rest
- impact extended to include all spell slots
- removed once per long rest tag

-<< TODO >>-
- playtest
-> this might actually be way overpowered

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- eldritch master may have been misnamed
-> it implied you were the master of eldritch magic
-> instead, your patron overlord is the eldritch master of you
- the idea of worshipping your patron over an hour or eight is hilarious
