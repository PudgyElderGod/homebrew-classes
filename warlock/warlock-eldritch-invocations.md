## Eldritch Invocations
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

### Agonizing Blast
***Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip***

When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

### Arcing Blast
***Prerequisite: 13th level, eldritch blast cantrip***

When you cast eldritch blast, you create one more beam than normal. You can direct this extra beam at your original target or at a different one. Make a seperate attack roll for each beam.

### Armor of Shadows
You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Ascendant Step
***Prerequisite: 5th level***

You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Beast Speech
You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Beguiling Influence
You also become proficient in two skills of your choice from the following skills: Animal Handling, Deception, Persuasion, or Insight.

### Book of Ancient Secrets
***Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature***

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells, and can cast them as rituals.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- the phrase *without materials* is removed
- many invocations that let you cast a spell once have been removed
-> those lost spells have been added to the warlock spell list instead
- most invocations have reduced level prereqs
- book of ancient secrets is buffed
-> allows for those ritual spells to be cast using a spell slot
-> allows for other warlock spells to be cast as a ritual
- added 'arcing blast' to double eldritch blast damage
-> eldritch blast has been changed
-> eldritch blast is a bonus action to cast, doesn't level, can be upcast, deals lightning damage, and deals 1d8 damage

-<< TODO >>-
- maybe add more invocations
- improve book of ancient secrets wording

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- I hated the invocations that let you cast a spell once per long rest
-> a warlock's abilities should all recharge on a short rest, sans a few exceptions
-> these invocations might as well be added to spell list
-> too much micromanagement
-> the ones that let you cast level 1+ spells for free are great, though
- most the abilities have been unchanged
- the levels have been reduced
-> you can't learn an invocation that casts a leveled spell for free unless you have spell slots for the next level up, at least.
