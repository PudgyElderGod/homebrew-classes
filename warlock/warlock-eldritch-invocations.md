## Eldritch Invocationist
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain one eldritch invocation of your choice.
Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.
When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.
You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.
A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to your level in this class.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- the phrase *without materials* is removed
- many invocations that let you cast a spell once have been removed
-> those lost spells have been added to the warlock spell list instead
- most invocations have reduced level prereqs
- book of ancient secrets is buffed
-> allows for those ritual spells to be cast using a spell slot
-> allows for other warlock spells to be cast as a ritual
- added 'arcing blast' to double eldritch blast damage
-> eldritch blast has been changed
-> eldritch blast is a bonus action to cast, doesn't level, can be upcast, deals lightning damage, and deals 1d8 damage

-<< TODO >>-
- maybe add more invocations
- improve book of ancient secrets wording

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- I hated the invocations that let you cast a spell once per long rest
-> a warlock's abilities should all recharge on a short rest, sans a few exceptions
-> these invocations might as well be added to spell list
-> too much micromanagement
-> the ones that let you cast level 1+ spells for free are great, though
- most the abilities have been unchanged
- the levels have been reduced
-> you can't learn an invocation that casts a leveled spell for free unless you have spell slots for the next level up, at least.
