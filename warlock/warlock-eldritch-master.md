## Eldritch Champion
You have gained the ultimate gift from your patron.
You are openly welcome to their home &mdash; whether that's a fortress, a maze, or an entire plane &mdash; and have proper credentials for you and anyone you travel there with (if necessary).
Sentinals and other dwellers of your patron's home will protect you during your stay.

You also know of a teleportation sigil near or in the home so that you may access it via *plane shift* or similar magic.

Finally, if you give your patron atleast one week notice, they will clear up their schedule to personally meet with you in their home.
