## Pact Boon
You have negotiated the terms of your pact with your patron to include one of the following features of your choice.

### Pact of the Blade
Bestowed upon you is the knowledge and ability of a lost fighting technique. Choose two simple or martial weapons of your choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons.

When you gain this feature, your patron loans you the service of a magical weapon. This weapon usually takes the form of any +1 sword of your choice. The weapon is not yours to keep; your patron can recall it at any time.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. At the end of the ritual, the weapon is dismissed and is shunted into an extradimensional space. You can't affect a legendary artifact or a sentient weapon in this way.

You gain the ability to conjure your pact weapon or any mundane weapon at will. As a bonus action, you create the weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form of a mundane weapon each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options).

A weapon summoned in this way disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

The bond to your pact weapon breaks if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Pact of the Chain
You learn the find familiar spell. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. Creatures summoned by your find familiar spell can make attacks on its turn.

When you gain this feature, your patron loans you the service of a familiar companion. This familiar usually takes on one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Consult your DM for other potential options that could be available.

If your special familiar dies, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest. The familiar is freed from its service to you when you die.

### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows.

With this book in hand, you can cast any warlock spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

When you gain this feature, choose two cantrips from any class's spell list (the spells needn't be from the same list). The chosen spells count as warlock spells for you and don't count against your number of spells known.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- pacts have been tweaked
- pact of the chain explicitly allows attacks from familiar
- pact of the tome refers to spell list, not cantrip list
- pact of the blade summons on bonus action not action

-<< TODO >>-
- QC passes needed
-> this is an alpha ability
- review and revise

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this ability was quickly put together as a placeholder for something greater
- the pact boon is touched but once or twice (via invocations) with vanilla
- this gives an ultimate ability at level 19, preferably something stupid good (simple yet powerful)
