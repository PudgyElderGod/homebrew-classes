## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 20th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved 19th level ASI to 20th level

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- This change is primarily made as a paradigm shift.
	- Level 20 should be a huge deal to get to.
	- Getting the ASI @lv19 encouraged multiclassing 19/1.
	- This is fine, but level 20 should be ever-so tempting.
	- Likewise, 10th-level spell slots now appear @lv19.
- Players are encouraged to multiclass @lv16, at the latest.
	- (instead of @lv19)
	- This maximizes ASI's while still multiclassing
- Getting to a 20th level class should be an achievement.
- Every level-up is a temptation to multiclass.
