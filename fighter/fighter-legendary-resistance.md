## Unrelenting Grit 
Beginning at 9th level, if you fail a Saving Throw, you can choose to succeed instead.
If an attack hits you, you can choose to avoid the attack instead, causing it to miss.
You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 13th level.
