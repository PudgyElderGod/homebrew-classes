## Strength Before Death
By 18th level, you have become all too familiar with death, but continue to relent nevertheless.

When you start **dying**, you can choose to retain your consciousness.
When you do so, you are able to act as normal&mdash;even as you draw your last breaths.

A surge of adrenhiline and determination washes over you in this state.
Whenever you land an attack while **dying**, it is considered a critical hit.

While you are **dying**, you can choose to fall **unconscious** at any time on your turn (no action required).

Finally, you do not die until you take on five failed death saves instead of three.
