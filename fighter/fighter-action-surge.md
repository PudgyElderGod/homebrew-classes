## Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 20th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- second powerup moved to 20th level
- this was swapped with extra attack 3

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- action surge is more useful for non-martial characters than extra attack 3
-> multiclassing with fighter 17 shouldn't boost spellcasters as much as martials
-> spellcasters get enough love as it is
-> therefore, action surge 2 is moved to 20th level
- 19th level alone is really a powerboost (while 18th is a ribbon)
- those levels should be enough motivation to get to 20th level, especially with an ASI
