## Veteren
At 18th level, you gain proficiency in a saving throw of your choice.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- trying to keep a simple but powerful ability
- emulating bard ability that gives save to everything

-<< TODO >>-
- think about this ability
- potentially change its dircection

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this ability needs to be resource-free.
-> already fighter has to keep track of second wind, legendary resistance, and action surge
- this ability needs to convice a player not to multiclass
- this ability must be dumb-simple
- giving a saving throw proficiency of your choice is actually quite potent
