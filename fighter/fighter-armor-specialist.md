## Armor Specialist
You are used to wearing a particular type of armor to protect yourself. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Armor Specialist option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Unarmored
While you are not wearing any armor, you gain an extra +3 to AC and Dexterity saving throws when you are in partial cover.

### Shield
While you have a shield equipped, you can take a bonus action to gain +1 AC until the end of your next turn.

### Lightly Armored
While you are wearing light armor, you can take a reaction to try to dodge, imposing disadvantage on a single incoming attack.

### Balanced
You gain an extra +1 AC while you are wearing medium armor.

### Heavily Armored
While you are wearing heavy armor, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from nonmagical weapons is reduced by 2.

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- this is based off of fighting style
- centered around armor styles

-<< TODO >>-
- reword grammar
- !FIX unbalanced options
- !FIX poorly thought out options

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- moving second wind to 3rd level made a void that needed to be filled
- fighter needed a buff anyway - by third level fighter gets lots of goodies now
-> improved second wind
-> action surge as normal
-> fighting style as normal
-> subclass choice
-> tactician for damage
-> armor specialist for survivability
- compare that to before
-> second wind
-> fighting style
-> action surge
-> subclass
