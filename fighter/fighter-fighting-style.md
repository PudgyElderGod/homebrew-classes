## Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options.
You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Archery
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and s you make with ranged weapons.

### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling
When you are wielding a single medium-sized or smaller melee weapon, your critical hits with that weapon do thrice the damage dice and modifiers instead of twice.
The weapon must not have the heavy or two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.

### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can choose to reroll any number of the damage dice; but you must use the new rolls.
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of your offhand attacks.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- archery
-> changed +2 accuracy to +1 damage +1 accuracy
- dueling
-> focuses on crit builds with lesser weapons than great weapons
- great weapon fighting
-> still favors greatswords, allows rerolls on 3's
-> viable for greataxes now, allows rerolls on 6's
- two-weapon fighting
-> offhand attack(s) is now plural

-<< TODO >>-
- check if offhand is proper words
- add other UA XGE etc proper fighting styles

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- action surge 2 and extra attack 3 have been swapped
- this gives martial multiclasses more oomph, and gives fighter itself more consistant power a bit earlier
- multiclass spellcasters get less benefit from this, intentionally (they get enough goodies)
