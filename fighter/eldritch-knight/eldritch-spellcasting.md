## Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
The Eldritch Knight table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells.
If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight table shows how many wizard spells you know, and how many you learn when you level up.
The spells that you can know are strictly limited to the abjuration, conjuration, evocation, and necromancy schools of magic.
You must choose these spells from the wizard spell list.
Each of these spells must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Eldritch Knight table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Eldritch Knight table.

### Preparing Spells
The wizard spells that you know are always considered prepared to cast.
