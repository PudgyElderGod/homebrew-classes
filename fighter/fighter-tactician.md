## Tactician
You have the practiced knowledge necessary to hit your enemy where it hurts most.
When make an Attack Roll, you can declare a number between `1` and `your Fighter Level` to take as a penalty to hit.
If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to your chosen penalty.
You can only use this feature before you make your Attack Roll.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a brand new ability
- it is based off of two feats
-> great weapon master
-> sharpshooter

-<< TODO >>-
- fix up grammar and verbiage

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this ability is meant to kill off sharpshooter and great weapon master
-> those feats are too strong, and can actually be generalized into an ability
- this ability is a button, and it never has to be used
-> this ability gives fighter some interesting options in combat
-> sometimes a fighter feels like they have so few options and just swing around a blade all day
-> in a sense, this replaces the "called shots" trope for skilled archers and blademasters.
