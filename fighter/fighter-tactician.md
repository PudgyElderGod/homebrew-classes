## Tactician
By 2nd level, you have the knowledge and control to hit your enemy where it hurts most.
When you first make an attack with a melee weapon, you can declare a number, and take it as a penalty to hit.
If your attack hits, it does extra damage equal to your initial penalty.
You can only use this ability before you make your roll to hit.


<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a brand new ability
- it is based off of two feats
-> great weapon master
-> sharpshooter

-<< TODO >>-
- fix up grammar and verbiage

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- this ability is meant to kill off sharpshooter and great weapon master
-> those feats are too strong, and can actually be generalized into an ability
-> this ability is a button, and it never has to be used
-> this ability gives fighter options in combat
-> sometimes a fighter feels like they have so few options and just swing around a blade all day
