## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 17th level in this class.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- second powerup moved to 17th level

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- action surge 2 and extra attack 3 have been swapped
- this gives martial multiclasses more oomph, and gives fighter itself more consistant power a bit earlier
- multiclass spellcasters get less benefit from this, intentionally (they get enough goodies)
