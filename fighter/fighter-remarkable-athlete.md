## Remarkable Athlete
Starting at 10th level, you have mastered your physical technique.
From this point onwards:
- Swimming doesn't cost you extra movement.
- Climbing doesn't cost you extra movement.
- You can now lift and carry 100lbs more than you normally could.
- When you are **prone**, standing up does not use any of your movement.
- You can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 5 feet to your high jump distance.

- this is based off
-> feat: athlete
-> battle-master feature: remarkable athlete

-<< TODO >>-
- fix spelling grammar and wording

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- a ribbon ability meant to boost fighter's roleplay at 10th level
-> 10th level is a ribbon ability for many classes including rogue monk fighter druid
- compared to old abilities, has more utility and clear-cut numbers (no +3ft jump bonus)
