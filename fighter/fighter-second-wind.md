## Second Wind
Beginning at 3rd level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm.
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to a number of `d4`'s equal to your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 19th level, you can use it twice before a rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is no longer an onboarding ability
-> moved to level 3
- buffing ability to heal 1d4 per fighter level
-> Nd4 > 1d10 + N @ level 4
-> leaving it at level 1 or 2 would be really anticlimatic
-> characters could die for rolling some 1's during combat
-> instead, better armor options available at level 1
- adding second powerup at 19th level
-> being able to heal 19d4 twice per short rest before using hit dice is very impressive
-> effectively adding 100 hit points to HP pool - hit dice hardly used

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- action surge is more useful for non-martial characters than extra attack 3
-> multiclassing with fighter 17 shouldn't boost spellcasters as much as martials
-> spellcasters get enough love as it is
-> therefore, action surge 2 is moved to 20th level
- 19th level alone is really a powerboost (while 18th is a ribbon)
- those levels should be enough motivation to get to 20th level, especially with an ASI
