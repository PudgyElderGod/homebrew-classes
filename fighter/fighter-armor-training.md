## Armor Practice
You are used to wearing a particular type of armor to protect yourself.
Choose one of the following options.
You can't take the same Armor Practice option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Agility
You gain a `+3` bonus to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws while you are benefitting from partial cover and aren't wearing any armor.

### Rebuttal
If you would have been hit by an attack while wearing light armor, you can use a reaction to parry the attack.
When you do so, the attacker rerolls their attack against you, and they must use the new roll.

### Balance
You gain a `+1` bonus to AC while you are wearing medium armor.

### Endurance
While you are wearing heavy armor, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take is reduced by `â€“2`.

-<< CHANGES >>-
- this is a new ability
- this is based off of fighting style
- centered around armor styles

-<< TODO >>-
- reword grammar
- !FIX unbalanced options
- !FIX poorly thought out options

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- moving second wind to 3rd level made a void that needed to be filled
- fighter needed a buff anyway - by third level fighter gets lots of goodies now
-> improved second wind
-> action surge as normal
-> fighting style as normal
-> subclass choice
-> tactician for damage
-> armor specialist for survivability
- compare that to before
-> second wind
-> fighting style
-> action surge
-> subclass
