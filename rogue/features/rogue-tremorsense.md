## Tremorsense
Starting at 14th level, you gain tremorsense so long as you can feel or hear. You can treck through pitch darkness by using the vibrations in the ground â€” like a mole.

Your tremorsense does not obsolete stealth or illusions, although it can aid you in discovering them. Tremorsense can be obscured by an abundance or lack of vibrations in the ground, such as finding a creature who is flying or amidst a large battle.
