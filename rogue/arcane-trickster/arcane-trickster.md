# Arcane Trickster
Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of transmutation, divination, enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers. These rogues learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

## Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

### Cantrips
Arcane Tricksters can learn cantrips alongside their other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Spell Slots
The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard cantrips or spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

### Spells Known
You know three cantrips or spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard cantrips or spells. Each of these spells must be either a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 8th level in this class, you can learn one new cantrip or spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Magic School Limitation
The spells that you know and learn from this class must come from the divination, enchantment, illusion, or transmutation schools of magic.

### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`

## Mage Hand Legerdemain
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the *mage hand* cantrip. This spell doesn't count towards your total number of known spells. For you, *mage hand* has a variety of unique properties:

- You can take a bonus action to cast this spell.
- You can take a bonus action to control the hand once it is cast.
- You can make the spectral hand visible or invisible when you first cast the spell or control it thereafter.
- You don't require a verbal component to cast this spell.
- You can use the hand to retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can use the hand to stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can use the hand with thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.
- You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Passive Wisdom (Perception).

## Magical Ambush
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell until the beginning of your next turn.

## Versatile Trickster
At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage hand. Using your mage hand, you can use the help or distract action. In doing this, you are able to benefit from either effect yourself.

In addition, you ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of spell scrolls.

## Spell Thief
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell, you can use your reaction to cast *counterspell* at 3rd-level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, the spell's range is extended to 300 feet. If a target's spell is successfully interrupted, you also steal its knowledge of the spell if it targeted you or included you in an area of effect. This has the following implications:
- You know the spell (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell).
- You can cast the spell using your spell slots.
- You can create spell scrolls of the spell to use later.
- The creature can't cast that spell until it takes a long rest or until 24 hours have passed.

These effects last until you take a long rest or until 24 hours have passed, unless otherwise specified. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
