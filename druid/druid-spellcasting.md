## Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells. If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
You have an innate knowledge of every spell on the druid spell list, however you must prepare them before you are able to cast them.

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. Your spellcasting ability will influence the maximum number of spells you can prepare. Each spell must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Druid table.

`Max. prepared spells = your druid level + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus`

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
