## Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others can spot a message's presence with a successful Wisdom check but can't decipher it without days of dedicated research, or magic.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- now requires an indistinct Wisdom check
- required research to decipher instead of impossibility

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the changes made here should keep the language a bit more kosher and up to the DM.
