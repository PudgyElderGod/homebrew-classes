# Circle of the Moon
Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.

## Combat Wild Shape
You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. Likewise, you can now use a bonus action to revert back into your original form.

In addition, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Circle Forms
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as ½ (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

## Enhanced Wild Shape
At 6th level, you have synced your spiritual energies with a diverse cast of natural entities. You are no longer limited to Beasts when you use Wild Shape. You can now expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a Dragon or Elemental, and can expend one use of Wild Shape to turn into a Plant.

## Thousand Forms
By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You learn the *Alter Self* spell. For you, this spell counts as a Cantrip, and does not require concentration.
