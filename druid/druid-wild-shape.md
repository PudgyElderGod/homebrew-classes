## Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action and magically convoke a spirit animal into your body to assume its form.

To convoke a spirit animal, you must have made a significant impact on an individual beast - be it in its life or after its death. Once you have done so, you can commune with its spirit to tie a metaphysical bond with it.

As a druid, you have already communed with two CR 0 beasts and one CR ¼ beast of your choice.

You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Wild Shape twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower.

***Beast Shapes***

| Level | Max CR | № Uses |
|-:-:---|-:-:----|-:------|
| 2nd   | ¼      | 1      |
| 4th   | ½      | 1      |
| 6th   | 1      | 2      |
| 8th   | 2      | 2      |
| 18th  | 2      | 3      |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die outright.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your traits and game statistics are replaced by the traits and statistics of the beast, but you can choose to retain your...
	- alignment
	- personality
	- Intelligence score
	- Wisdom score
	- Charisma score
	- proficiency bonus
- You gain all proficiencies from the beast, but also keep your...
	- skill proficiencies
	- saving throw proficiencies
	- weapon proficiencies
- Your movement and senses are replaced by the movement and senses of the beast.
- If the creature has any Legendary Actions, Lair Actions, or Regional Effects, you can't use them.
- When you first transform, you temporarily assume the beast's...
	- hit points
	- hit dice size
	- hit dice pool
- When in your new form, you can use Wild Shape again to fully heal your current hit points.
- When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points & hit dice you had before you transformed.
- If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
	- For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.
	- When you revert forms in this way, you are knocked unconscious.
- You can use the *shillelagh* spell while in beast form to amplify your natural attacks.
- Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
- The above rule extends to taking certain actions or using certain features, including...
	- attacking with weapons like scimitars
	- casting spells that require a verbal or somatic component
	- utilizing features from your class, race, or other sources
- Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell that you've already cast.
- Your beast form doesn't prevent you from taking actions that are a part of spell that you've already cast.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
	- The DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment.
	- Worn equipment functions as normal.
	- Worn equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form.
	- Any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
	- Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
