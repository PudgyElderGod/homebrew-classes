## Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

### Cantrips
Druids can prepare cantrips alongside their other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to `your Wisdom modifier + your Proficiency Bonus + your druid level (minimum of one spell).` The spells must be either a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have two 1st-level and one 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight cantrips or spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
