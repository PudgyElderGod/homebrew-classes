## Timeless Body
Starting at 10th level, the primal magic that you wield grants you power over your life force. You can change the appearance of your body's age after a long rest, and you can't be aged magically. You can now only die of old age if you choose to do so at the end of a long rest.

- added rules about old age
- added fluff about changing your age on demand

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the changes in this fluff ability really make me happy
- lined up ability at level 10 along with many other classes' fluff
- the idea of a timeless child druid or ancient wise druid makes me pretty happy
- a druid like this shouldn't be able to die from old age, unless they choose to do so
