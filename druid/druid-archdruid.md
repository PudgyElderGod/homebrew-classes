## Archdruid
At 20th level, you can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the end of your turn.

In addition, if you transform into a creature that has legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects, you can now utilize them. Any spent legendary actions roll over when you transform.

### Wild Shape
***Cost: 1 actions***

You use your Wild Shape ability.

### Primal Savagery
***Cost: 2 actions***

You make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range.

### Force of Nature
***Cost: 3 actions***

You cast one spell of 5th-level or lower.
