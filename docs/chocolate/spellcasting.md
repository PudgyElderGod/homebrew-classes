### Recharging Spent Spell Slots
Aside from taking a long rest, you have several options to regain your spell slots.

You can drink a vial of holy water to regain one 1st-level spell slot.

You can spend ten minutes praying at a place of holy significance to regain one 2nd-level spell slot. Your ritual must consume an offering worthy enough to pay respects on sacred grounds.

When you significantly further your divine cause—enough for your god or goddess to notice—they might reward you with a surge of divine power. In this instance, you can recharge one 3rd-level spell slot.
