# Giant Soul (UA)
The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.

## Soul of Lost Ostoria




## Rage of the Fallen Sons
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend a spell slot, you can increase your size by one categoryâ€”from Medium to Large, for example.

This increase lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you enjoy the following benefits:

Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by 1 per sorcerer level.
Your reach increases by 5 feet.
Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks; the bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Blessing of the All-Father
At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 24.

In addition, you can now use Rage of Fallen Ostoria twice between rests, but no more than once on a turn. If you use that feature while under its effects, its increases to your size, hit points, reach, and walking speed are cumulative.
