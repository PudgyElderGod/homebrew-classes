# Giant Soul (UA)
The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.

## Jotun Resilience
The resilience of giants flows through your body. At 1st level, your hit dice size increases to 1d8.

## Mark of the Ordning
At 1st level, you discover innate magical abilities within yourself that are based on your giant heritage. Select one of the giant types from the Mark of the Ordning table. At 1st and 3rd level, you learn the spells associated with your choice, as shown in the table. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

## Ancestor's Gift
By innately understanding the power of arcane glyphs, you can utilize them when you cast spells. When you do so, the spells you cast are more efficient and require fewer materials. You gain the *Efficient Spell* Metamagic option.

##### Cloudborn Spell

***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that does no damage, you can spend one sorcery point to make all sensory aspects of the spell unnoticeable.

##### Stoneborn Spell

On a failure, that creature is stunned until the start of your next turn.

## Soul of Lost Ostoria
At 6th level, you learn how to use the *Enlarge* spell. If you already know this spell, you can learn any spell from the sorcerer spell list.

However, if you cast this spell and target yourself, the spell has several changes.
- The spell's cost is reduced to 1st-level.
- The spell's casting time is reduced to one bonus action.
- The spell no longer requires concentration, but ends if you die or are incapacitated.

## Rage of the Fallen Sons
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend a spell slot, you can increase your size by one categoryâ€”from Medium to Large, for example.

This increase lasts for 10 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you enjoy the following benefits:

- Your size category increases by one
- Your size doubles in all dimensions
- Your mass & weight are multiplied by 8
- Your weapons and equipment grow to match your new size
- Your attacks with these weapons use twice the damage dice and damage modifiers
	- This bonus becomes thrice the damage when you stack this ability using Blessing of the All-Father, or with the Enlarge spell active
	- This bonus becomes four times the damage when you stack this ability using Blessing of the All-Father with the Enlarge spell active
- You use a d24 instead of a d20 whenever you roll for Strength attacks, ability checks, and saving throws
	- This bonus dice becomes a d30 when you stack this ability using Blessing of the All-Father.
- Your melee reach increases by 5 feet
- Your walking speed increases by 5 feet
- Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by your `Sorcerer level + Constitution modifier + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus`

This ability stacks with the Enlarge spell. At 18th level, you can use this ability twice, and its effects will stack with itself.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Blessing of the All-Father
At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 4, up to a maximum of 24.

In addition, if you use Rage of the Fallen Sons while under its effects, its bonuses are cumulative. If a specific effect mentions how it might stack up using this ability, then do that instead.

#### Enlarge
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V S M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause a creature or an object that you touch to grow larger for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. The creature gains the following effects:

- The target's size category increases by one
- The target's size doubles in all dimensions
- The target's mass & weight are multiplied by 8
- The target's weapons and equipment grow to match its new size
- The target's attacks with these weapons use twice the damage dice and damage modifiers
- The target has advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws

If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. In this circumstance, the DM may declare that the creature becomes restrained.
