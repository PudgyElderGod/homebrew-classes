# Welcome, Traveler.
> You come across a rickety bridge — spanning a large chasm between the two continents. As you look down the sheer cliff, a massive scape of rocks flows down astoundingly far into a pillowy abyss of thick clouds. If you were to fall, the clouds would not save you...

> But you are at the verge of an uncharted land, and you must press forward!

*This website is the aforementioned uncharted land.* It is home to an array of modifications to the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It takes the game and spins it on its head, giving a new look and feel. These changes are only made possible through D&D's robust modularity, which this very website is a testament to.

## What You Will Find
This website is currently structured to showcase Player Classes. Other modifications do exist, but are not published here.

### Classes & Subclasses
Each class has atleast one subclass. For example, there is only one Fighter page, however fighter has several subclasses — namely champion, battle master, and eldritch knight. `/fighter`, `/fighter/champion`, `/fighter/battle-master`, and `/fighter/eldritch-knight` are each a different web page on this site.

### New & Old
Both the original and modified version of each item is available on this website in different pages. They are nested in folders named original and homebrew.
