# College of Lore
Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

## Cutting Words
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, a saving throw, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines the outcome of the roll. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

## Additional Magical Secrets
At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be either a cantrip or of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you, but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.

## Legendary Performance
Starting at 14th level, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to do a performance and inspire your audience. You can perform in this way for a number of minutes and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.

For every minute that you spend performing, you can choose one creature (including yourself) within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you.

At the end of the performance, each creature that you chose gains one Bardic Inspiration die.
