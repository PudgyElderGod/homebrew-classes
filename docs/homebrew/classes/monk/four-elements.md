# Way of the Four Elements
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.

## Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this section for the Four Elements Spell List.

### Cantrips
The Way of the Four Elements teaches cantrips alongside other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Ki Magic
You have drawing out your Ki to power your spellcasting. So long as you are not incapacitated, you can seemlessly convert Ki Points to Spell Slots (and vice versa) at absolutely any time, without expending any actions.

### Spell Slots
The Way of the Four Elements is a special arcane subclass in that it doesn't provide any spell slots for you to cast your spells with. Instead, you will have to rely on your *Ki Resevoir* feature to create spell slots. You can also now create spell slots of a level less than or equal to your Maximum Slot Level, as shown on the Four Elements Spellcasting Table. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

### Spells Known
You know three cantrips or spells of your choice from the Four Elements Spell List, outlined at the back of this section.

The Spells Known column of the Four Elements Spellcasting Table shows when you learn more four elements cantrips or spells. Each of these spells must be either a cantrip or of a level less than or equal to your Maximum Slot Level, as shown on the Four Elements Spellcasting Table. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new cantrip or spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the elemental quartet spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Four Elements Spell List. The new spell must be of a level less than or equal to your Maximum Slot Level.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your elemental quartet spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to your inner self and the nature around you. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Inner Focus
You can use your own inner focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

## Elemental Attunement
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the *Elemental Attunement* cantrip. This spell doesn't count towards your total number of known spells.

## Disciple of the Elements
You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. These initial disciplines do not require you to spend ki points. Choose one of the following disciplines to learn:

### Hurricane Wind Throw
You can treat simple thrown weapons as monk weapons for the purposes of Martial Arts. In addition, you may make attacks with simple thrown weapons in place of unarmed strikes when you use your Flurry of Blows ability.

### Grasp of the Earth
A creature that is grappled by you is restrained. Grappling a creature does not slow your movement. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice: Athletics, History, or Intimidation.

### Burning Tongue Stance
You can make opportunity attacks with your unarmed strikes without using your reaction.

### Flowing Water Style
Your attacks with unarmed strikes and monk weapons are not impaired by being underwater. You gain a swim speed equal to your movement speed. You can hold your breath for ten times as long as normal.

## Elemental Apprentice
By 6th level, you have spent significant time studying and practicing the philosophy of the Four Elements. You have learned to empower your abilities with elemental ki. Choose one of the following techniques to learn:

### Flaming Fang
***Cost: 2+ points***
On your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. A hit with such an unarmed strike deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

If you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d12 fire damage.

### Water Whip
***Cost: 2+ points***

As an action, you can spend 2 or more ki points to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 slashing damage (whichever does more), plus an extra 1d10 slashing damage for each additional ki point you spent. You can then push or pull the target up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground, and either knock it prone or freeze it to the ground. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and doesn't suffer from the the other effects.

### Piercing Gale
***Cost: 2+ points***

As an action, you can spend 2 or more ki points to create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a barrage of the sharpest spears. A line 120 feet long and 5 feet wide of wind blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in its path must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 piercing damage, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage for each additional ki point you spent, is pushed 15 feet away from you and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage, and doesn't suffer from the other effects.

### Earthen Prison
***Cost: 2+ points***

As an action, you can spend 2 or more ki points to force creature into the earth below it. You target a large or smaller creature standing within 5 feet of you. The ground within 5 feet of it becomes difficult terrain. It must make a Strength Saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point that you spent, and is thrust into the ground below it as the earth molds to trap it. The creature becomes prone, restrained, and incapacitated until it escapes. It can make a Strength Saving throw in attempts to escape at the end of its turns. If the creature succeeds on its save, it takes half damage and doesn't suffer from the other effects.

## Elemental Expert
At 11th level, you have gained mastery over casting elemental spells. Choose one of the elemental quartet spells that you know of 3rd level. It becomes a 2nd level spell for you, and you can cast it using spell slots at that level or higher.
