# Monk
<!-- (PHB p76; XGE p32) -->
Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

## The Magic of Ki
Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

## Training and Asceticism
Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.

Monks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly combatants, their abilities on a par with those of a raging barbarian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of all monastic study. By coming to know oneself completely, one learns much of the wider world.

A monk's focus on inner mastery leads many such individuals to become detached from society, more concerned with their personal experience than with happenings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed of an already rare type of character, taking their quest for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the world at large.

Playing a monk character offers many intriguing opportunities to try something different. To distinguish your monk character even further, consider the options in the sections that follow.

## Monastery
A monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the exception of adventurers and others who have reason to leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source of support in times of need.

What sort of place was your monastery, and where is it located? Did attending it contribute to your experience in an unusual or distinctive way?

###### Monastery

| d6  | Monastery                                                                                                                                    |

| 1   | Your monastery is carved out of a mountainside, where it looms over a treacherous pass.                                                      |
| 2   | Your monastery is high in the branches of an immense tree in the Feywild.                                                                    |
| 3   | Your monastery was founded long ago by a cloud giant and is inside a cloud castle that can be reached only by flying.                        |
| 4   | Your monastery is built beside a volcanic system of hot springs, geysers, and sulfur pools. You regularly received visits from azer traders. |
| 5   | Your monastery was founded by gnomes and is an underground labyrinth of tunnels and rooms.                                                   |
| 6   | Your monastery was carved from an iceberg in the frozen reaches of the world.                                                                |

## Icon
Even in the monastic lifestyle, which eschews materialism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an important part in defining the identity of an order. Some monastic orders treat certain creatures with special regard, either because the creature is tied to the order's history or because it serves as an example of a quality the monks seek to emulate.

If your character's monastery had a special icon, you might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identifying mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not have a physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a posture that you adopt, and which other monks might know how to interpret.

|:---:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Monkey. Quick reflexes and the ability to travel through the treetops are two of the reasons why your order admires the monkey.                                                  |
| 2   | Dragon Turtle. The monks of your seaside monastery venerate the dragon turtle, reciting ancient prayers and offering garlands of flowers to honor this living spirit of the sea. |
| 3   | Ki-rin. Your monastery sees its main purpose as watching over and protecting the land in the manner of the ki-rin.                                                               |
| 4   | Owlbear. The monks of your monastery revere a family of owlbears and have coexisted with them for generations.                                                                   |
| 5   | Hydra. Your order singles out the hydra for its ability to unleash several attacks simultaneously.                                                                               |
| 6   | Dragon. A dragon once laired within your monastery. Its influence remains long after its departure.                                                                              |

## Master
During your studies, you were likely under the tutelage of a master who imparted to you the precepts of the order. Your master was the one most responsible for shaping your understanding of the martial arts and your attitude toward the world. What sort of person was your master, and how did your relationship with your master affect you?

###### Master

|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Your master was a tyrant whom you had to defeat in single combat to complete your instruction.                                                         |
| 2   | Your master was kindly and taught you to pursue the cause of peace.                                                                                    |
| 3   | Your master was merciless in pushing you to your limits. You nearly lost an eye during one especially brutal practice session.                         |
| 4   | Your master seemed goodhearted while tutoring you, but betrayed your monastery in the end.                                                             |
| 5   | Your master was cold and distant. You suspect that the two of you might be related.                                                                    |
| 6   | Your master was kind and generous, never critical of your progress. Nevertheless, you feel you never fully lived up to the expectations placed on you. |

# Class Features
## Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

## Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals `9 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.`

## Martial Arts
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapon. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- You have proficiency with your monk weapons.
- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.
- You can take a bonus action to make one attack with an unarmed strike.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.
	- This die increases in size as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- You can choose to deal non-lethal damage with your unarmed strikes and your monk weapons.
- You can replace any unarmed strike you make with an attempt to shove or grapple a creature.
- You can use Dexterity when you attempt to shove or grapple a creature.

## Ki Resevoir
Starting at 1st-level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. 

You have 2 ki points, and you gain additional ki points every time you level up, as shown on the Monk Table. You regain all spent ki points and lose any superfluous ki points when you finish a short or long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

At 1st-level level, you are limited to using your ki points to create Spell Slots; this is only useful if you have the ability to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher. If you don't, then you can ignore the proceeding *Ki Energies* subsection.

You learn more practical ways to use your ki points as you reach higher levels.

### Ki Energies
You can use your ki points to create spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional ki points. 

You can only create a spell slot if it is at a level for which you know spells. If you do not know any spells, then you cannot create any spell slots.

#### Converting Ki Points
You can transform unexpended ki points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. To do so, spend a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

#### Converting a Spell Slot
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous ki points vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

###### Ki Points

| Spell Slot Level | Ki Point Conversion Rate |
|:----------------:|:------------------------:|
| Cantrip          | 0                        |
| 1st              | 2                        |
| 2nd              | 3                        |
| 3rd              | 5                        |
| 4th              | 6                        |
| 5th              | 7                        |
| 6th              | 9*                       |
| 7th              | 10*                      |
| 8th              | 11*                      |
| 9th              | 12*                      |

## Ki Channeler
By 2nd level, you have learned to spend your ki points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw against your Spell Save DC to resist the feature's effects.

### Flurry of Blows
***Cost: 1 point***

You can take a bonus action to make two unarmed strikes. When you reach 11th level, you can make one additional unarmed strike with this feature.

### Patient Defense
***Cost: 2 points***

You can take a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and Dexterity Saving Throws until the start of your next turn.

### Step of the Wind
***Cost: 3 points***

You can take a bonus action to use the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions simultaneously. Your jump distance is also doubled for the turn.

## Tempered Action
Starting at 2nd level, your practiced muscle memory and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Search action.

## Ki Flow
At 3rd level, you have practiced enough that you can spend your ki on features to avoid taking imminent damage. You know two new defensive ki features: Deflect Blows, and Graceful Fall.

### Deflect Blows
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction to deflect a weapon when you are hit with a weapon attack. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction. If you also have a hand free, then you can catch ranged missiles and melee weapons if they are small enough to carry and use with one hand.

When you catch a melee weapon in this way, you can attempt to disarm your aggressor, as a part of the same spent reaction. Make a Dexterity check against your opponent's Strength Save DC. On a success, you take the weapon in your free hand.

When you catch a ranged missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the missile that you just caught, as part of the same spent reaction. The missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

### Graceful Fall
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction when you fall to break your impact. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the fall is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you gain a fly speed equal to the distance you fell until the end of your turn.

## Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

## Unarmored Movement
At 3rd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Ki Fury
At 5th level, you have practiced enough to weaponize your ki. You know two new offensive ki features: Empowered Strike and Stunning Strike.

### Empowered Strike
***Cost: 2 points***

You have learned to empower your melee attacks with an abundance of ki energy. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 ki points to make the attack a critical hit. When you do so, you can choose to replace the attack's damage type with force damage. In addition, this attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Stunning Strike
***Cost: 1 point***

You have learned to interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body using pressure points. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Ki Adept
At 7th level, you have learned expert Ki techniques allowing you to dodge even explosions and strokes of lightning. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

In addition, you now know two new expert ki features: Matrixial Evasion and Surge of Health.

### Superior Evasion
***Cost: variable***

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use a reaction to dodge out of the effect's path. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the failed save is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you can move up to 10 feet without provoking an opportunity attack, as a part of the same spent reaction.

### Surge of Health
***Cost: variable***

As an action, you can focus your mind and restore vitality with your ki. To do so, you can spend a number of ki points. You regain 1d4 hit points for each ki point spent.

## Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against magical illusions and enchantments, and on ability checks to discern whether such magic is present. You have a resistance to psychic damage.

In addition, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

## Dash of Legends
At 9th level, when you take the Dash action, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling if you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield. This effect persists until the end of your next turn. This effect also ends when you attack, cast a spell, or take damage.

## Purity of Body
Starting at 10th level, you have ultimate control over your body. Your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can now only die of old age if you choose to do so at the end of a short or long rest.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws with potions and against diseases and poisons; you have resistance against poison damage. You can use your action to cure yourself of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting you.

## Tongue of the Sun and Moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

## Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, you gain blindsense so long as you can hear or smell. You can treck through pitch darkness by using subtle smells or echoes in the air — much like a bat.

Your blindsense does not obsolete stealth or illusions, although it can aid you in discovering them. Blindsense can be obscured by liquids, walls (even glass windows), and an abundance or lack of smells and sounds, such as in a noisy, rancid tavern or somehow in outer space.

## Diamond Soul
Beginning at 15th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

## Empty Spirit
Beginning at 18th level, you have mastered the most difficult of ki techniques. You know two new spell-like ki features: Greater Invisibility and Astral Projection.

### Greater Invisibility
***Cost: 6 points***

You can use your action to spend 6 ki points and cast the *Greater Invisibility* spell on yourself at 4th-level without expending a spell slot. During this time, you have resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Astral Projection
***Cost: 12 points***

You can use your action to spend 12 ki points and cast the *Astral Projection* spell at 9th-level without expending a spell slot. You don't need any material components to target yourself with the spell.

## Perfect Self
At 20th level, your training has reached a legendary level. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
