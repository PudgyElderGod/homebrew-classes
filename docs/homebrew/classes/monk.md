## Martial Arts
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapon. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

- You can choose to deal non-lethal damage with your unarmed strikes and your monk weapons.
- You can replace any unarmed strike you make with an attempt to shove or grapple a creature.
- You can use Dexterity when you attempt to shove or grapple a creature.

## Ki Resevoir
Starting at 1st-level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. 

You have 2 ki points, and you gain additional ki points every time you level up, as shown on the Monk Table. You regain all spent ki points and lose any superfluous ki points when you finish a short or long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

At 1st-level level, you are limited to using your ki points to create Spell Slots; this is only useful if you have the ability to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher. If you don't, you can ignore the proceeding *Ki Energies* subsection.

You learn more practical ways to use your ki points as you reach higher levels.

### Ki Energies
You can use your ki points to create spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional ki points.

#### Converting Ki Points
You can transform unexpended ki points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. To do so, spend a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

#### Converting a Spell Slot
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous ki points vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

## Ki Channeler
By 2nd level, you have learned to spend your ki points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw against your Spell Save DC to resist the feature's effects.

### Flurry of Blows
***Cost: 1 point***

You can take a bonus action to make two unarmed strikes. When you reach 11th level, you can make one additional unarmed strike with this feature.

### Patient Defense
***Cost: 1 point***

You can take a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and Dexterity Saving Throws until the start of your next turn.

### Step of the Wind
***Cost: 2 points***

You can take a bonus action to use the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions simultaneously. Your jump distance is also doubled for the turn.

## Tempered Action
Starting at 2nd level, your practiced muscle memory and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Search action.

## Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

## Ki Flow
At 3rd level, you have practiced enough that you can spend your ki on features to avoid taking imminent damage. You know two new defensive ki features: Deflect Blows, and Graceful Fall.

### Deflect Blows
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction to deflect a weapon when you are hit with a weapon attack. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction. If you also have a hand free, then you can catch ranged missiles and melee weapons if they are small enough to carry and use with one hand.

When you catch a melee weapon in this way, you can attempt to disarm your aggressor, as a part of the same spent reaction. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against your opponent's Strength Save DC. On a success, you take the weapon in your free hand.

When you catch a ranged missile in this way, and you can make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the missile that you just caught, as part of the same spent reaction. The missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

### Graceful Fall
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction when you fall to spend a number of ki points, breaking your fall. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the fall is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you gain a fly speed equal to the distance you fell until the end of your turn.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Ki Fury
At 5th level, you have practiced enough to weaponize your ki. You know two new offensive ki features: Empowered Strike and Stunning Strike.

### Empowered Strike
***Cost: 2 points***

You have learned to empower your melee attacks with an abundance of ki energy. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 ki points to make the attack a critical hit. When you do so, you can choose to replace the attack's damage type with force damage. In addition, this attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Stunning Strike
***Cost: 1 point***

You have learned to interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body using pressure points. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against magical illusions and enchantments, and on ability checks to discern whether such magic is present. You have a resistance to psychic damage.

In addition, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

## Ki Adept
At 7th level, you have learned expert Ki techniques allowing you to dodge even explosions and strokes of lightning. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

In addition, you now know two new expert ki features: Matrixial Evasion and Surge of Health.

### Superior Evasion
***Cost: variable***

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use a reaction to dodge out of the effect's path. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the failed save is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you can move up to 10 feet without provoking an opportunity attack, as a part of the same spent reaction.

### Surge of Health
***Cost: 1 point***

You can use your action to focus your mind and restore vitality. To do so, you can spend a number of ki points. You regain 1d4 hit points for each ki point spent.

## Dash of Legends
At 9th level, when you take the Dash action, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling if you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield. This effect persists until the end of your next turn. This effect also ends when you attack, cast a spell, or take damage.

## Purity of Body
Starting at 10th level, you have ultimate control over your body. Your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can now only die of old age if you choose to do so at the end of a short or long rest.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws with potions and against diseases and poisons; you have resistance against poison damage. You can use your action to cure yourself of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting you.

## Tongue of the Sun and Moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

## Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, you gain blindsense so long as you can hear or smell. You can treck through pitch darkness by using subtle smells or echoes in the air — much like a bat.

Your blindsense does not obsolete stealth or illusions, although it can aid you in discovering them. Blindsense can be obscured by liquids, walls (even glass windows), and an abundance or lack of smells and sounds, such as in a noisy, rancid tavern or somehow in outer space.

## Diamond Soul
Beginning at 15th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

## Empty Spirit
Beginning at 18th level, you have mastered the most difficult ki techniques. You know two new spell-like features: Greater Invisibility and Astral Projection.

### Greater Invisibility
***Cost: 6 ki points***

You can use your action to spend 6 ki points and cast the *Greater Invisibility* spell on yourself at 4th-level. During this time, you have resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Astral Projection
***Cost: 12 ki points***

You can use your action to spend 12 ki points and cast the *Astral Projection* spell at 9th-level. You don't need any material components to target yourself with the spell.

## Perfect Self
At 20th level, your training has reached a legendary level. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
