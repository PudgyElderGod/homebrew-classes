# Druid
<!-- (PHB p64; XGE p21) -->
Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.

Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.

Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.

Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

## Power of Nature
Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.

Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals — the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.

## Preserve the Balance
For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world — air, earth, fire, and water — must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.

Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.

Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.

> *Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.*

Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.

Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.

## Treasured Item
Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.

When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?

|:---:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | A twig from the meeting tree that stands in the center of your village |
| 2   | A vial of water from the source of a sacred river                      |
| 3   | Special herbs tied together in a bundle                                |
| 4   | A small bronze bowl engraved with animal images                        |
| 5   | A rattle made from a dried gourd and holly berries                     |
| 6   | A miniature golden sickle handed down to you by your mentor            |

## Guiding Aspects
Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.

| 1   | Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.                                             |
| 2   | Oak trees represent strength and vitality. Meditating under an oak fills your body and mind with resolve and fortitude.                          |
| 3   | The river's endless flow reminds you of the great span of the world. You seek to act with the long-term interests of nature in mind.             |
| 4   | The sea is a constant, churning cauldron of power and chaos. It reminds you that accepting change is necessary to sustain yourself in the world. |
| 5   | The birds in the sky are evidence that even the smallest creatures can survive if they remain above the fray.                                    |
| 6   | As demonstrated by the actions of the wolf, an individual's strength is nothing compared to the power of the pack.                               |

## Mentors
It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.

If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?

| 1   | Your mentor was a wise treant who taught you to think in terms of years and decades rather than days or months.                                                     |
| 2   | You were tutored by a dryad who watched over a slumbering portal to the Abyss. During your training, you were tasked with watching for hidden threats to the world. |
| 3   | Your tutor always interacted with you in the form of a falcon. You never saw the tutor's humanoid form.                                                             |
| 4   | You were one of several youngsters who were mentored by an old druid, until one of your fellow pupils betrayed your group and killed your master.                   |
| 5   | Your mentor has appeared to you only in visions. You have yet to meet this person, and you are not sure such a person exists in mortal form.                        |
| 6   | Your mentor was a werebear who taught you to treat all living things with equal regard.                                                                             |

## Learning Beast Shapes
The Wild Shape feature in the player's handbook lets you transform into a beast that you've seen. That rule gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it easy to amass an array of beast form options for yourself, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast Shapes table in that book.

When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the monster manual according to the beasts' most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2nd level.

These tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.

The tables include all the individual beasts that are eligible for Wild Shape (up to a challenge rating of 1) or the Circle Forms feature of the Circle of the Moon (up to a challenge rating of 6).

# Class Features
When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

## Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

## Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

### Cantrips
Druids can prepare cantrips alongside their other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to `your Wisdom modifier + your Proficiency Bonus + your druid level (minimum of one spell).` The spells must be either a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have two 1st-level and one 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight cantrips or spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a druid spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

## Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action and magically convoke a spirit animal into your body to assume its form.

The connection that you have with the beast's soul must be unbreakable to use this ability. You must have had a significant impact on the beast's soul and commune with it — be it in life or after death.

You have already communed with one CR 0 beast of your choice. Transforming into a CR 0 beast does not expend a use of this feature.

You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Wild Shape twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Beast Transformation
Your druid level dictates the maximum power of the beasts that you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of ¼ or lower.

###### Beast Shapes

| Level | Max. CR | No. Uses |
|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 2     | ¼       | 1        |
| 4     | ½       | 1        |
| 6     | 1       | 2        |
| 8     | 2       | 2        |
| 18    | 2       | 3        |
 
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you can choose to retain your...
	- alignment
	- personality
	- Intelligence score
	- Wisdom score
	- Charisma score
	- skill proficiencies
	- saving throw proficiencies
	- proficiency bonus
- Your movement and senses are replaced by the movement and senses of the beast.
- If the creature has any Legendary Actions or Lair Actions, you can't use them.
- When you first transform, you temporarily assume the beast's...
	- hit points
	- hit dice size
	- hit dice pool
- When in your new form, you can use Wild Shape again to fully heal your current hit points.
- When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points & dice you had before you transformed.
- If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
	- For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. 
	- When you revert forms in this way, you are knocked unconscious.
- Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
- You can use the spell *shillelagh* while in beast form to amplify your natural attacks.
- The above rule extends to taking certain actions or using certain features, including...
	- attacking with weapons like scimitars
	- casting spells that require a verbal or somatic component
	- utilizing features from your class, race, or another source
- Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell that you've already cast.
- Your beast form doesn't prevent you from taking actions that are a part of spell that you've already cast.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
	- The DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment.
	- Worn equipment functions as normal.
	- Worn equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form. 
	- Any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
	- Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Druid Circle
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

## Druid's Companion
At 5th level, you can use an action to call forth a beast companion to accompany you in difficult times.

The DM first determines whether an animal would come to aid depending on your current surroundings. If the call for help is successful, then the DM chooses a beast and assumes control of it. At most, it should have a CR that matches your Wild Shape ability.

Though the beast is likely feral, it senses your kinship and can come to aid you in various situations.

The beast will leave your service if you overcome your foremost obstacles, if it becomes afraid of an obstacle, or if you signal to it that its help is no longer needed.

If your beast companion dies, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

## Timeless Body
Starting at 11th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Beast Spells
Beginning at 17th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape regardless of the form that you choose.

## Archdruid
At 20th level, you can now use legendary actions or lair actions while using Wild Shape, if your form has any.

You can also take 3 legendary actions when you are in your original form, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the end of your turn. When you transform using Wild Shape, you are set with 0 legendary actions remaining.

### Natural Instinct
***Cost: 1 actions***

You make one ability check that has to do with the natural environment around you.

### Wild Shape
***Cost: 2 actions***

You use your Wild Shape ability to transform.

### Weapon Attack
***Cost: 3 actions***

You make one weapon attack.
