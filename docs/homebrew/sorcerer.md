# Sorcerer
<!-- (PHB p99; XGE p48) -->
Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.

Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.

Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

## Raw Magic
Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.

The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.

Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.

## Unexplained Powers
Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.

Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.

When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.

Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.

Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.

Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on how to flesh out and personalize your persona.

## Arcane Origins
Some sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.

Does your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't know where their power arose from, your DM can use this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.

## Reaction
When a new sorcerer enters the world, either at birth or later when one's power becomes evident, the consequences of that event depend greatly on how its witnesses react to what they have seen.

When your sorcerer's powers appeared, how did the world around you respond? Were other people supportive, fearful, or somewhere in between?

| 6   | Your powers are believed to be tied to an ancient line of mad kings that supposedly ended in a bloody revolt over a century ago. |

## Supernatural Mark
A sorcerer at rest is almost indistinguishable from a normal person; it's only when their magic flies forth that sorcerers reveal their true nature. Even so, many sorcerers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them apart from other folk.

If your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be one that's easily concealed, or it could be a source of pride that you keep on constant display.

| 4   | Your hair grows at a prodigious rate.                                       |
| 5   | You wrinkle your nose repeatedly while you are chewing.                     |
| 6   | A red splotch appears on your neck once a day, then vanishes after an hour. |

## Signs of Sorcery
As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But even when one's magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from.

When your sorcerer character casts a spell, does the effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is this sign tied to your origin or some other aspect of who you are, or is it a seemingly random phenomenon?

| 3   | You sweat profusely while casting a spell and for a few seconds thereafter.                             |
| 4   | Your hair and garments are briefly buffeted about, as if by a breeze, whenever you call forth a spell.  |
| 5   | If you are standing when you cast a spell, you rise six inches into the air and gently float back down. |
| 6   | Illusory blue flames wreathe your head as you begin your casting, then abruptly disappear.              |

# Class Features
## Creating a Sorcerer
The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.

## Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

Sorcerers must learn each of their spells before they can cast them — however, once they know a spell, they always have it prepared to use.

### Cantrips
Sorcerers can learn cantrips alongside their other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Spell Slots
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

### Spells Known
You know six 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

## Sorcerous Origin
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, from the list of available origins

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Origin Spells
Each origin has a list of spells — its origin spells — that you gain at the sorcerer levels noted in the origin description. Once you gain a origin spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a origin spell that doesn't appear on the sorcerer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a sorcerer spell for you.

## Font of Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain additional sorcery points every time you level up, as shown on the Sorcerer Table. You regain all spent sorcery points and lose any superfluous sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

You learn several different ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to recover spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.

#### Converting Sorcery Points
You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. To do so, spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Sorcery Points Table.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest.

#### Converting a Spell Slot
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Sorcery Points Table.

Superfluous sorcery points vanish at the end of a long rest.

###### Sorcery Points Table

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Conversion Rate |
|:----------------:|:-----------------------------:|

*You must roll on the wild magic table when you convert a spell slot of this level.*

## Metamagic
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs.

You first unlock one unique Metamagic option, detailed in your chosen Sorcerous Origin.

When you reach 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain one of the following Metamagic options of your choice.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Careful Spell
***Cost: 1—3 points / creature***

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force.

To do so, you must spend 1 sorcery point for each creature that you want to protect. A chosen creature has advantage on any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn..

You can instead spend 3 sorcery points per creature to completely mitigate any of the spell's direct effects against them until the start of your next turn.

### Distant Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than self, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase the range of the spell.

The spell's range increases to either double range or to 30ft, whichever is greater.

### Suspended Spell
***Cost: 3 points***

When you cast a spell, you can spend 3 sorcery points to suspend the spell midair. The spell becomes trapped in an orb of energy, which requires your concentration to maintain — as if you were casting a spell.

While you concentrate, you can use a bonus action to move the orb in any direction up to the spell's casting range, and activate it if you desire. If the spell's range is self or touch, it cannot move.

When you activate the suspended orb, it breaks, and its stored spell immediately takes effect in its place, as if you cast the stored spell in that instant.

If you lose concentration or if the orb is outside your field of view when your turn begins, the orb is activated.

### Efficient Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that requires costly material components, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to overcharge your arcane energies and reduce the minimum required costs of those components by half.

### Elemental Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change its damage type to another one of those listed.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Empowered Spell
***Cost: 2 points***

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the results. You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration.

In addition, you have advantage on any concentration checks made to maintain this spell.

### Flection Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to bend the spell around corners. When you do this, you can target creatures around such obstacles.

If a creature targeted by this spell has left your field of vision before the end of your last turn, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls that this spell might require.

### Focused Spell
***Cost: 2 points***

When you cast a spell that requires one or more attack rolls, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on those rolls for this casting of the spell.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Heightened Spell
***Cost: 3—7 points / creature***

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can intensify the spell's full force on some of those creatures.

To do so, you must spend 3 sorcery points for each selected creature that you want to affect. A chosen creature has disadvantage on any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

You can instead spend 5 sorcery points per selected creature to make them automatically fail any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

### Instinctive Spell
***Cost: variable***

You can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to cast any spell on the sorcerer spell list — even if you haven't learned the spell.

As normal, you must spend the associated level spell slot when you cast the spell.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Quickened Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Subtle Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

You can use Subtle Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Twinned Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate cast the spell a second time simultaneously.

If a creature would be effected by both castings of this spell, it is instead only effected by one of them.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

## Unlimited Power
Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you regain a number of sorcery points equal to one-third of the spell slot's level, rounded down.
