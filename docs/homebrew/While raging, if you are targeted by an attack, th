While raging, if you are targeted by an attack, then you can use your reaction to make a retaliatory manuevar.

Your manuevar you first grants you a dodge action. Next, after the attack is resolved, you can attempt a grapple or shove attack against your aggressor if they are within 5 feet of you.


While you are raging, if you jump atleast 10 feet in any direction onto a target creature, you can use a bonus action to make a predator's strike.

Your predator's strike first grants you a shove attack against your target. Next, once before the turn ends, you can deal bonus damage to your target when you hit it with an attack. This bonus equals 1d6 extra damage for every 10 feet that you jumped past the original 10 feet required.

Your *Rage*, *Reckless Attack*, and *Brutal Critical* features now also function with ranged and thrown weapons.
