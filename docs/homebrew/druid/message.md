Hey Jasmine!! Finally got around to modifying Druid. I've been doing several changes, but wanted to offer what I had in store for your subclass.

Personally, I like the direction of the subclass a lot, but it has an identity crisis... 
...You deal necrotic, which is weak versus their enemy (undead)
...You are an avatar of life and death, but Cleric already does that
...You are enabled orbital-cannon damage, by stacking AoE with your Harvest's Scythe

In order to change this, I emphasized a few key points.
- You can only target one opponent at a time with *Harvest's Scythe*
- You can choose to deal all of your d10 pool at once with *Harvest's Scythe*, rather than half
- *Harvest's Scythe's* healing ability is now a variant of paladin's Lay on Hands
- I give you one free circle spell at 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level
	- inflict wounds (originally cleric spell)
	- moonbeam (druid spell)
	- speak with dead (replaces weak level-6 ribbon ability)
	- death ward (originally cleric spell)

## Harvest's Scythe
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your attacks to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a weapon or spell attack that has no more than one target, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as radiant and necrotic â€” whichever deals more damage.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Harvest's Bounty
If you kill a creature with an attack augmented in this way, you gain a pool of healing power equal to the amount of hit points that the creature had left before dying. This pool of healing dissipates when you take a long rest.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.
