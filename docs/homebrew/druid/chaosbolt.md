You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

###### Chaos Bolt
| d6  | Damage Type |
|:---:|:------------|
| 1   | Poison      |
| 2   | Psychic     |
| 3   | Force       |
| 4   | Fire        |
| 5   | Cold        |
| 6   | Lightning   |

If you roll two of the same numbers on any pair of d6s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
