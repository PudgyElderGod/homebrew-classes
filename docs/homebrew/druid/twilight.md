# Circle of Twilight
The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

## Harvest's Scythe
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your attacks to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a weapon or spell attack that targets only one creature, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as radiant and necrotic — whichever deals more damage.

To be eligible, the attack must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren’t eligible, but Ray of Frost is.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Harvest's Bounty
If you kill a creature with an attack augmented in this way, you gain a pool of healing power equal to the amount of hit points that the creature had left before dying. This pool of healing dissipates when you take a long rest.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to life and death infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd and 5th level you gain access to circle spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Watcher at the Threshold
At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. When a spell you cast deals either necrotic or radiant damage, you can choose to switch its damage type.

In addition, you have advantage on death saving throws.

## Paths of the Dead
You have attuned to the planes of life and death, and can quickly switch between those planes.

While you are on the Border Ethereal, you can use an action to pull open a small portal to the Deep Ethereal. This portal is one way, and lasts until you leave the Border Ethereal or until you use an action close it.

In addition, you can bend the rules of the universe while you are in the Border Ethereal. When you first enter the Border Ethereal, your form follows *Ethereal Law*. While you are there, you can use an action to start following *Traveler's Law*, or again to start following *Ethereal Law*.

### Ethereal Law
While you are in the Ethereal Plane, gravity doesn't affect you, and you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear into the plane that you are bordering, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane that you are bordering.

### Traveler's Law
While you are in the Ethereal Plane, gravity doesn't affect you, and you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear into the plane that you are bordering, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you appear whispy and ghostly, and you can only affect and be affected by creatures on the plane that you are bordering. Other creatures that are on the Ethereal Plane can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when you start following *Traveler's Law*, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

If you drop an item while following *Traveler's Law*, it is deposited on the plane that you are bordering. If you start following *Ethereal Law* while you are carrying an inanimate object no more than one size smaller than you, it follows you to the Ethereal plane.

> ##### The Ethereal Plane
> The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. Its “shores,” called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal is limited to 60 feet The plane’s depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal where visibility is limited to 30 feet.
> 
> Characters can use the 7th-level *etherealness* spell to enter the Border Ethereal. The 7th-level *plane shift* spell allows transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, but unless the intended destination is a specific location or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on the plane.
> 
> ###### Border Ethereal
> From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, and can’t see anything beyond 60 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid of magic.
> 
> Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can’t attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don’t hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ethereal. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as easily as walking.
> 
> ###### Deep Ethereal
> To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a 7th-level *plane shift* spell or arrive by means of a magical portal. Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by rolling mist. Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild, or the Shadowfell. The color of the curtain indicates the plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals.
> 
> Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures are considered to move at their normal speeds.
