# Circle of Twilight
The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

## Harvest's Scythe
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your attacks to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a weapon attack, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as radiant and necrotic — whichever deals more damage.

### Harvest's Bounty
If you kill a creature with an attack augmented in this way, you gain a pool of healing power equal to the amount of hit points that the creature had left before dying. This pool of healing dissipates when you take a long rest.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to life and death infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Speech Beyond the Grave


## Watcher at the Threshold
At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. When a spell you cast deals either necrotic or radiant damage, you can choose to switch its damage type.

In addition, you have advantage on death saving throws — and while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you has advantage on death saving throws.

## Paths of the Dead
At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to tread the paths used by ghosts and other spirits. Using this feature, you can cast etherealness. Once the spell ends, you can't cast it with this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
