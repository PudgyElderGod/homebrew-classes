# College of Valor
Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

## Combat Inspiration
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a saving throw or damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

## Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Battle Magic
At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act.

In place of a weapon attack, you can cast one spell of 1st-level or higher with a casting time of 1 action.

## Cantrip Caster
Also at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

Alternatively, you can forego one weapon attack to cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
