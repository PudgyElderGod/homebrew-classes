# Acid Splash
- [x] *Action*

You hurl a bubble of acid at a point you choose within range, which explodes on impact. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. You have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks for the duration.

# Accursed Touch
- [x] *Bonus Action*

Your touch calls forth a tenebrous hand which rends the mortal spirit. Make a melee spell attack against a target creature to grab it, assailing it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 necrotic damage, and the shadowy hands cling to the target until the end of your next turn. Until then, it can't regain hit points.

# Dancing Lights
- [x] *Bonus Action*

You create up to six torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air until dispelled. You can also combine the six lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

When you cast this spell, or as a bonus action on a later turn, you can move the lights to a new spot within range. A light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

# Druidcraft
- [x] *Bonus Action*

Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:
- You create a small natural effect, such as a showering of snowflakes, a puff of cloud, a small orb of sunlight, and so on.
- Your magic inspires the wildlife around you, such that you can instantly make flowers blossom, cause seed pods to open, spawn a troop of mushrooms, or amplify natural fragrances.
- You produce minor effects in the environment, such as falling leaves from trees, breezes from the wind, or a chattering among small animals nearby.
- You can 'read' the thoughts and feelings of simple plants. They tend hyperfocus on their current state of being.
- You have a subdued power over the elements. For example, you can instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You use these harmless sensory effects to predict what the weather will be at your location in the near future.

The environment you effect returns to its natural order briefly after casting this spell.

> Druidcraft is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not limited by its description, but instead your imagination.

# Firebolt
- [x] *Bonus Action*

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

# Friends
- [x] *Action*

For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and could become hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.

# Guidance
- [x] *Action*

You touch one willing creature. The target gains a brief foresight into the immediate future, granting it a bonus +1d4 to all ability checks for the duration.

# Light
- [x] *Bonus Action*

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

# Mage Hand
- [x] *Action*

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it ever exceeds the spell's range or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, cast spells, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. It also cannot handle complex tasks that could require an ability check.

# Mending
- [x] *1 minute*

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

# Message
- [x] *Action*

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

# Minor Illusion
- [x] *Action*

You create a small illusion within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. When you cast this spell, choose one faculty of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch. Your illusion immitates this (and only this) faculty.

If a creature uses its action to examine the illusion, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint and warbly to the creature.

### Image
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This image can be animated with a disjointed farce of motion, so long as it remains within the original 5-foot cube. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

### Scent
If you create a false scent, you pick its odor and intensity. It can fill an area no larger than a 30-foot cube. A powerful enough illusory scent will cover the trace of other scents in the area, and vice-versa. You can change the dynamic of this smell throughout the spell's duration.

### Sound
If you create a replica of sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

### Flavor
If you create a fascimile of flavor, it radiates throughout the air. A creature will taste this illusion only when they believe that they should be tasting something. You determine the sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and spiciness of the flavor-among various other factors of your choice.

### Texture
If you add an illusion of texture, it clings to surfaces within range, including creatures. This texture can be soft, warm, cold, painful, rough, slimey, wet, dry, sandy, etcetera. A less believable texture may arouse suspicion more readily.

# Poison Spray
- [x] *Action*

You extend your hand and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. Each creature in a 10-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 poison damage on a failed save.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level.

# Prestidigitation
- [x] *Bonus Action*

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice, producing one of the following magical effects within range:
- You create an small sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, a strange odor, and so on.
- You etch a small mark, symbol, or color appear onto an object or a surface.
- You transform the shape of a simple, nonmagical trinket that can fit in your hand.
- You produce a short-lived illusory image that can fit in your hand.
- You have a subdued power over the elements. For example, you can instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You chill, heat, soil, clean, or flavor up to 1-cubic foot of material.

The environment you effect returns to its natural order briefly after casting this spell.

> Prestidigitation is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not limited by its description, but instead your imagination.

# Produce Flame
- [x] *Action*

A flickering flame appears in one of your hands. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius. The spell ends if you wield another item or spell with that hand, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as a bonus action, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level.

# Ray of Frost
- [x] *Action*

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d10 cold damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, its speed is halved until the end of your next turn.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the spell produces one additional beam for each slot level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

# Resistance
- [x] *Action*

You touch one willing creature. A thin veil of shimmering magic forms around it, granting it a +2 bonus to all saving throws for the duration.

# Sacred Flame
- [x] *Action*

### At Higher Levels

# Shillelagh
- [x] *Bonus Action*

You raise your weapon to the sky or hold it to the earth, imbuing it with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again, let go of the weapon, or dismiss it as an action.

> This spell is compatible with unarmed strikes. Similarly, this spell can be cast and utilized while in beast form. 

# Shocking Grasp
- [x] *Bonus Action*

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level.

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal, or can alter the appearance of your eyes.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color.
- You call upon a sound. Supernatural forces reciprocate-producing rumbles of thunder, the cries of a raven, ominous whispers, light footsteps, etcetera.
- You cause strange anomolies in the laws of physics, messing up gravity, time, space, and other phenomena. 
- You affect objects around you, such as causing unlocked containers, doors, and windows to fly open and slam shut.
- You have a subdued power over the elements. For example, you can conjure a tuft of flame, cause harmless tremors in the ground, attain a freezing touch, or produce an unnatural breeze.

The environment you effect returns to its natural order briefly after casting this spell.

> Thaumaturgy is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not limited by its description, but instead your imagination.

# Thorn Whip
- [x] *Bonus Action*

You create a long, vine-like whip that lashes out at your command toward a target in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, you can pull the target up to 10 feet closer to you. Such a creature also becomes flatfooted until the end of your next turn.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level.

# True Strike
- [x] *Action*
