While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you can choose to retain your...
	- alignment
	- personality
	- Strength score
	- Dexterity score
	- Constitution score
	- Intelligence score
	- Wisdom score
	- Charisma score
	- proficiency bonus
- You gain all proficiencies from the beast, but also keep your...
	- skill proficiencies
	- saving throw proficiencies
	- weapon proficiencies
- Your movement and senses are replaced by the movement and senses of the beast.
- If the creature has any Legendary Actions or Lair Actions, you can't use them.
- When you first transform, you temporarily assume the beast's...
	- hit points
	- hit dice size
	- hit dice pool
- When in your new form, you can use Wild Shape again to fully heal your current hit points.
- When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points & dice you had before you transformed.
- If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
	- For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. 
	- When you revert forms in this way, you are knocked unconscious.
- You can use the *shillelagh* spell while in beast form to amplify your natural attacks.
- Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
- The above rule extends to taking certain actions or using certain features, including...
	- attacking with weapons like scimitars
	- casting spells that require a verbal or somatic component
	- utilizing features from your class, race, or other sources
- Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell that you've already cast.
- Your beast form doesn't prevent you from taking actions that are a part of spell that you've already cast.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
	- The DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment.
	- Worn equipment functions as normal.
	- Worn equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form. 
	- Any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
	- Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
