Hey Jasmine! Finally decided on what your sword does.

```

## Magic
This weapon is a +2 magic shortsword. 

## Attunement
This item requires attunement. Without it, its properties are no different than a regular shortsword, except all attacks with it have disadvantage.

## Damage
3d6+2 necrotic or slashing damage (whichever does more).

## On hit
You regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt with this sword.

## Command
This weapon has 9 charges. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can speak the command word to attempt to tear its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). When you do so, your target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an additional 1d120 necrotic or slashing damage (whichever does more), and the sword loses one charge.

## Curse
This sword is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat. On a failed save you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.
```

Extra notes:
- Technically the sword does 1d6 slashing + 2d6 + 2 necrotic, but I simplified it :thumbsup:
- You can't recharge the sword's 9 charges, so be sure you want to use them!
- The extra damage from using a charge doubles on a critical hit.
- Something interesting happens when you use all 9 charges...

Secret notes:
- Destroying the blade rewards 20,000 exp split among those involved at the time (usually 8 people)
- Selling the blade to the merchant prince rewards 20,000 sp split among those involved at the time (usually 8 people)
