Beauty Domain (Twitter)
[Note: this subclass is likely not intended as official content: "For the curious, when building stuff for my own campaign I kind of don't care about balance. Anything I can break in design I can counterbreak five times as bad during a session, as needed. Plus, IMO stuff going sideways and weird is why I play the game." â€” Mike Mearls]
Beauty can both bend minds and inspire hearts. It is the force that compels others to lose control and give in to their impulses, but it can also awaken strength and determination to steel a forlorn heart.
Clerics of Beauty bring joy and hope to the world. They are the beacon of light that reminds us that some things are worth fighting for. They seek to bring peace and amity among the world's folk. They fight only when they must, and prefer to use their magic to end fights with as little bloodshed as possible.
At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.

Beauty's Refuge
Starting at 1st level, your mere presence is enough to inspire hope and determination in others. When you complete a short or long rest, up to 12 allies of your choice gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
Rebuke the Defiler
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain the ability to rebuke those who lash out at your in violence.
As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you inflicts damage, you force that creature to make a Wisdom save. On a failed saving throw, it takes psychic damage equal to the damage dealt. On a successful save, it takes half that damage.
If the creature made multiple attacks, select one attack to determine the damage dealt. If the creature used one or more effects that damaged multiple targets, choose the damage take by one of those targets from one of the effects.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

Channel Divinity: Beauty's Truce
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to quell the flame of violence.

This benefit lasts for one hour. While charmed by this ability, creatures consider all other creatures charmed by it to be their allies. They fight to defend them from attackers.
While this ability persists, absent any threat creatures charmed by it will rest, talk among themselves, share stories of their lives, create a communal feast using food and drink they carry, and generally act as if they are old friends, long separated and brought together again for a joyous reunion.
