## Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action and magically convoke a spirit animal into your body to assume its form.

The connection that you have with the beast's soul must be unbreakable to use this ability. You must have had a significant impact on the beast's soul and commune with it — be it in life or after death.

You have already communed with one CR 0 beast of your choice. Transforming into a CR 0 beast does not expend a use of this feature.

You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Wild Shape twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Beast Transformation
Your druid level dictates the maximum power of the beasts that you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of ¼ or lower.

###### Beast Shapes
| Level | Max. CR | No. Uses |
|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 2     | ¼       | 1        |
| 4     | ½       | 1        |
| 6     | 1       | 2        |
| 8     | 2       | 2        |
| 18    | 2       | 3        |
 
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you can choose to retain your...
	- alignment
	- personality
	- Intelligence score
	- Wisdom score
	- Charisma score
	- proficiency bonus
- You gain all proficiencies from the beast, but also keep your...
	- skill proficiencies
	- saving throw proficiencies
	- weapon proficiencies
- Your movement and senses are replaced by the movement and senses of the beast.
- If the creature has any Legendary Actions or Lair Actions, you can't use them.
- When you first transform, you temporarily assume the beast's...
	- hit points
	- hit dice size
	- hit dice pool
- When in your new form, you can use Wild Shape again to fully heal your current hit points.
- When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points & dice you had before you transformed.
- If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
	- For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. 
	- When you revert forms in this way, you are knocked unconscious.
- You can use the *shillelagh* spell while in beast form to amplify your natural attacks.
- Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
- The above rule extends to taking certain actions or using certain features, including...
	- attacking with weapons like scimitars
	- casting spells that require a verbal or somatic component
	- utilizing features from your class, race, or other sources
- Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell that you've already cast.
- Your beast form doesn't prevent you from taking actions that are a part of spell that you've already cast.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
	- The DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment.
	- Worn equipment functions as normal.
	- Worn equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form. 
	- Any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
	- Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
