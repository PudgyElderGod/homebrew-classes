## Druid's Companion
At 5th level, you can use an action to call forth a beast companion to accompany you in difficult times.

The DM first determines whether an animal would come to aid depending on your current surroundings. If the call for help is successful, then the DM chooses a beast and assumes control of it. At most, it should have a CR that matches your Wild Shape ability.

Though the beast is likely feral, it senses your kinship and can come to aid you in various situations.

The beast will leave your service if you overcome your foremost obstacles, if it becomes afraid of an obstacle, or if you signal to it that its help is no longer needed.

If your beast companion dies, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
