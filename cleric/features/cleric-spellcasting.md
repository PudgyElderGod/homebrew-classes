## Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells. If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
You have an innate knowledge of every spell on the cleric spell list, however you must prepare them before you are able to cast them.

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. Your spellcasting ability will influence the maximum number of spells you can prepare. Each spell must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Cleric table.

`Max. prepared spells = your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus`

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
