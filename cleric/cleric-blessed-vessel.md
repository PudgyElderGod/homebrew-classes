## Blessed Vessel
By 14th level, your body has become a reservoir of divine energy.
You gain resistance to radiant damage.

Your dead body is protected from decay and can't become undead.
If your dead body remains in the same place for seven days, its location becomes consecrated, as if the *hallow* spell was cast there.
If you ever are brought back to life, you retain memories of your afterlife.
