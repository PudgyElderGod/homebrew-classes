## Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects.
You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your divine domain.
Your domain will grant you additional effects as you advance in Cleric Levels, as noted in the domain description.

Some Channel Divinity effects require Saving Throws.
The DC for such effects from this class equals your Cleric Spell Save DC.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests.
When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved subclass channel divinity up one levels
- added 'malevolent action' to turn undead rather than being damaged.

-<< TODO >>-
- compare wording to PHB - get it close to verbatim

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- moving things around was very difficult to make it consistant with paladin.
- paladin gains this same channel divinity option.
