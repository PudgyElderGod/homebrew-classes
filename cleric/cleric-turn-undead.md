## Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to repel undead entities.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censure the undead.
Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it is *frightened* for 5 minutes or until it faces a malevolent action.

While *frightened*, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
It also can't take reactions.
For its action, it can use only the *dash* action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the *dodge* action.

### Destory Undead
When an undead fails its Saving Throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its Challenge Rating is at or below 0.
This threshold increases as you level up, as shown on the Cleric Table.
