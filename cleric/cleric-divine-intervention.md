## Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action.
Describe the assistance you seek, and roll `1d120 + your Wisdom Ability Score + your Cleric Level`.
If the result is higher than 120, your deity intervenes.
The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a short rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- changing percentile dice to 1d120
- changing equation to add some mods
- beefed up 20th level ability in some ways
- now requires a roll even at 20th level

-<< TODO >>-
- compare wording to PHB - get it close to verbatim
- check this list, and check it twice - last paragraph needs some clarity
- might switch up the bonus modifier to the d120

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- as a fan of the giant 120-sided die, this is the perfect use case.
- 100 sided dice are unbalanced
-> ...unless they take a form of a symetrical 2n-sided geometry like a d10.
- The insta-success at 20th level is removed
- 7 day refresh rate is reduced to long rest by 20th level
- is a short rest ability by 20th level if it fails
