## Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells. If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows how many ranger spells you know, and how many you learn when you level up. You must choose these spells from the ranger spell list. Each of these spells must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Ranger table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Ranger table.

### Preparing Spells
The ranger spells that you know are always considered prepared to cast.
