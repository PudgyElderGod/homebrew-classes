## Charming Chords
At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to influence the mind. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. You must concentrate on this feature as if it were a spell.

During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against enchantments and being frightened or charmed, while other creatures in the area have disadvantage on these checks. A creature must be able to hear you to gain these effects.

The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced, if your concentration ends, or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
