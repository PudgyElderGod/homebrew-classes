## Magical Secrets
By 2nd level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. When you learn a new spell from level-up, it can be from any class, including this one. A spell that you choose must be either a cantrip or of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn additional spells from any class at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.
