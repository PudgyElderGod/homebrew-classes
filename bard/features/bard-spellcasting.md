## Spellcasting
You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.

Bards must learn each of their spells before they can cast them — however, once they know a spell, they always have it prepared to use.

### Cantrips
Bards can learn cantrips alongside their other spells of 1st level and higher.

### Spell Slots
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.

### Spells Known
You know six cantrips or 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

You learn one additional bard spells of your choice at each level except 4th, 7th, 10th, 19th and 20th. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, you instead learn two additional bard spells of your choice. At 19th and 20th level, you do not learn any new bard spells. Each of these spells must be either a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new cantrip or spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be either a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

`Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

### Ritual Casting
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
