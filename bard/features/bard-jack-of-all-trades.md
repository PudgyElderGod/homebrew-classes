Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

For example, if you have a proficiency bonus of +1d4 and you roll a 4, it gives you bonus of +2. If you roll a 1, it gives you a bonus of Â±0.
