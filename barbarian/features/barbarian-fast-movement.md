## Fast Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by +5 feet. This bonus increases when you reach certain barbarian levels, as shown in the Barbarian table.

<!--
Changes:
- added extra fast movement column, as per monk's unarmored movement.
- unarmored movement scales slowly from 5 feet to 20 feet.
- in response, removed redundant features from class progression.
- moved initial boost to 2nd level.
- 10 feet mark kicks in at level 6.

Commentary:
- wanted to make this more inline with monk's unarmored movement.
- wanted to rename this ability to unarmored movement, but didn't.
- doing this would make it disfunctional with monk's ability.
- this reason is because two abilities with the same name cannot stack.

!TODO:
- add fast movement column in barbarian table
- rename fast movement to something more exciting
- rename unarmored defense to be in line with fast movement
