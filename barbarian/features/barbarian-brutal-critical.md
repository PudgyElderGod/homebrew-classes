## Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you get to roll extra dice when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack. Roll all of the attack's damage dice one extra time with any damage modifiers.

This increases to two additional rolls at 13th level and three additional rolls at 17th level.

<!--
Changes:
- increases damage from +1 weapon damage die.
- increases damage to all damage dice + modifier.
- all critical hits now give extra damage modifiers.

Commentary:
- this is a huge buff for brutal critical, allowing extra damage modifiers and multiple dice.
- the verbiage from the original ability was made to distinguish the greataxe from the greatsword.
- rather than nutering this traditional greataxe affinity, it can be displaced to another ability.

!TODO:
- displace greataxe affinity.
- ensure concise verbiage.
- specify new crit rules elsewhere.
