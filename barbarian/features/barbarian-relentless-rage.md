## Relentless Rage
Starting at 10th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can expend one use of your Rage as a reaction to remain conscious and regain 10 hit points.

<!--
Changes:
- change from 11th to 10th level.

!TODO:
- relentless Rage needs to become more consistant with a few other abilities.
- that includes sources like orc and paladin.
- using rage as a resource feels wierd. find an alternative
