-<< CHANGES >>-
- none

-<< TODO >>-
- this ability desperately needs a rework!
- move this ability down several levels.
- keep it in the same vein as rogue's reliable talent.

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the absolute nature of this feature makes it feel overpowering
- the reliable talent feature is used as a preface for this
- it comes so late in the game its hard to argue that it shouldn't be so powerful
