## Primal Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels.

<!--
Changes:
- notice the new levels for subclasses:
- before: 3 6 10 14
-  after: 3 7 11 15 19
- there are extra subclasses in this selection.

Commentary:
- this unifies class leveling across the board -- many more levels are shared in this way.
- the consistancy is made notwithstanding the displacement of abilities.

!TODO:
- potentially replace a level with a ribbon ability in the base class.
