## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

<!--
Changes:
- moved 19th level ASI to 20th level.

Commentary:
- this is done to discourage 19th/1st level multiclasses.
- it is also done to encourage a 16th/4th level multiclass or similar.
- this creates a gap at level 19, especially for spellcasters.
- other modified and additional features fill in this gap.

!TODO:
- check verbatim to PHB.
