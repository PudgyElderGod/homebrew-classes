## Feral Instinct
By 6th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, you are immune to the surprised condition.

<!--
Changes:
- reworked second point to be universal.
- changed from 7th level to 6th level

Commentary:
- I love the idea of advantage on initiative.
- the second point this ability brings is less clear:
-> "Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and arenâ€™t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn."
- the ragge sentance feels too conditional and adds confusion.
- removing the rage piece doesn't add too much power and clarifies the ability.
- adding surprised as a condition may make this much more simple.
- originally, surprised is not a condition.

!TODO:
- add surprised as a condition.
