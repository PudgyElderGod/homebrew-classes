## Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- You have advantage on Strength checks.
=======
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
>>>>>>> 39b34bd12412adfa044dbd37cf9d0de8fc163d86
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

<!--
Changes:
- the only thing that changes is the 'advantage on strength saving throws'.
- this now applies even outside of rage.

Commentary:
- other than that this ability is pretty much spot on.
