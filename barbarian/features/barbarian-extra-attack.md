## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<!--
Commentary:
- thinking of making damage go up by one damage dice instead.
- this would make greataxe significantly more powerful than greatsword or maul.
- this would change the balance of two-weapon fighting.
- this would be substantially weaker than two attacks (less damage modifiers).
- probably would be better to leave this classic ability how it is...
