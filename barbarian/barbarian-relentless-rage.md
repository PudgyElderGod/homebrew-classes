## Relentless Rage
Starting at 10th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can expend one use of your Rage to remain conscious and regain 10 hit points (no action required).

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- changed from 11th to 10th level

-<< TODO >>-
- relentless Rage needs to become more consistant with a few other abilities
- that includes sources like orc and paladin
- using rage as a resource feels wierd. find an alternative

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the epic feeling of a barbarian slowly winding down was significant in vanilla rules
- trying to emulate this whilst simplifying ruling will be a challenge
