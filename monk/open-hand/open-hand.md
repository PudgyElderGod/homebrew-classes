# Way of the Open Hand
Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

## Grasshopper Jump
At 3rd level, You can add 20 feet to your long jump distance and 10 feet to your high jump distance, and you no longer depend on a running start to achieve your full jump distance.

## Open Hand Technique
Starting at 3rd level, You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with an attack from a monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can freely impose one of the following effects on that target.
- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

## Wholeness of Body
At 6th level, you gain the ability to focus inwards and heal yourself. As an action, you can regain 1d4 hit points for each level you have in monk. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

## Tranquility
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a short or long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the end of your next short rest (the spell can end early as normal).

## Quivering Palm
By 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, can spend 5 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take a bonus action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you take this bonus action, the creature takes 1d120 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
