## Ki Flow
At 3rd level, you have practiced enough that you can spend your ki on features to avoid taking imminent damage. You know two new defensive ki features: Deflect Blows, and Graceful Fall.

### Deflect Blows
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction to deflect a weapon when you are hit with a weapon attack. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction. If you also have a hand free, then you can catch ranged missiles and melee weapons if they are small enough to carry and use with one hand.

When you catch a melee weapon in this way, you can attempt to disarm your aggressor, as a part of the same spent reaction. Make a Dexterity check against your opponent's Strength Save DC. On a success, you take the weapon in your free hand.

When you catch a ranged missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the missile that you just caught, as part of the same spent reaction. The missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

### Graceful Fall
***Cost: variable***

You can use your reaction when you fall to break your impact. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the fall is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you gain a fly speed equal to the distance you fell until the end of your turn.
