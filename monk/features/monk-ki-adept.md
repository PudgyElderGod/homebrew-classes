## Ki Adept
At 7th level, you have learned expert Ki techniques allowing you to dodge even explosions and strokes of lightning. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

In addition, you now know two new expert ki features: Matrixial Evasion and Surge of Health.

### Superior Evasion
***Cost: variable***

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use a reaction to dodge out of the effect's path. To do so, you must spend a number of ki points. The damage you take from the failed save is reduced by 1d8 per ki point spent.

If you reduce the damage to 0, then you regain your spent reaction, and you can move up to 10 feet without provoking an opportunity attack, as a part of the same spent reaction.

### Surge of Health
***Cost: variable***

As an action, you can focus your mind and restore vitality with your ki. To do so, you can spend a number of ki points. You regain 1d4 hit points for each ki point spent.
