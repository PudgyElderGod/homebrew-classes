## Purity of Body
Starting at 10th level, you have ultimate control over your body. Your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can now only die of old age if you choose to do so at the end of a short or long rest.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws with potions and against diseases and poisons; you have resistance against poison damage. You can use your action to cure yourself of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting you.
