## Ki Channeler
By 2nd level, you have learned to spend your ki points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw against your Spell Save DC to resist the feature's effects.

### Flurry of Blows

You can take a bonus action to make two unarmed strikes. When you reach 11th level, you can make one additional unarmed strike with this feature.

### Patient Defense

You can take a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and Dexterity Saving Throws until the start of your next turn.

### Step of the Wind
***Cost: 3 points***

You can take a bonus action to use the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions simultaneously. Your jump distance is also doubled for the turn.
