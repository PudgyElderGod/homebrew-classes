## Ki Fury
At 5th level, you have practiced enough to weaponize your ki. You know two new offensive ki features: Empowered Strike and Stunning Strike.

### Empowered Strike
***Cost: 2 points***

You have learned to empower your melee attacks with an abundance of ki energy. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 ki points to make the attack a critical hit. When you do so, you can choose to replace the attack's damage type with force damage. In addition, this attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Stunning Strike
***Cost: 1 point***

You have learned to interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body using pressure points. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
