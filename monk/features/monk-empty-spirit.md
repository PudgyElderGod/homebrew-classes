## Empty Spirit
Beginning at 18th level, you have mastered the most difficult of ki techniques. You know two new spell-like ki features: Greater Invisibility and Astral Projection.

### Greater Invisibility
***Cost: 6 points***

You can use your action to spend 6 ki points and cast the *Greater Invisibility* spell on yourself at 4th-level without expending a spell slot. During this time, you have resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Astral Projection
***Cost: 12 points***

You can use your action to spend 12 ki points and cast the *Astral Projection* spell at 9th-level without expending a spell slot. You don't need any material components to target yourself with the spell.
