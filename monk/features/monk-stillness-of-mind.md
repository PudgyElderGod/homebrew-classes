## Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against magical illusions and enchantments, and on ability checks to discern whether such magic is present. You have a resistance to psychic damage.

In addition, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
