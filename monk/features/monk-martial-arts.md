## Martial Arts
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapon. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- You have proficiency with your monk weapons.
- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.
- You can take a bonus action to make one attack with an unarmed strike.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.
	- This die increases in size as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- You can choose to deal non-lethal damage with your unarmed strikes and your monk weapons.
- You can replace any unarmed strike you make with an attempt to shove or grapple a creature.
- You can use Dexterity when you attempt to shove or grapple a creature.
