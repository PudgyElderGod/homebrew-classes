## Ki Resevoir
Starting at 1st-level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. 

You have 2 ki points, and you gain additional ki points every time you level up, as shown on the Monk Table. You regain all spent ki points and lose any superfluous ki points when you finish a short or long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

At 1st-level level, you are limited to using your ki points to create Spell Slots; this is only useful if you have the ability to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher. If you don't, then you can ignore the proceeding *Ki Energies* subsection.

You learn more practical ways to use your ki points as you reach higher levels.

### Ki Energies
You can use your ki points to create spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional ki points. 

You can only create a spell slot if it is at a level for which you know spells. If you do not know any spells, then you cannot create any spell slots.

#### Converting Ki Points
You can transform unexpended ki points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. To do so, spend a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

#### Converting a Spell Slot
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of ki points equal to the spell's conversion rate, as shown in the Ki Points Table.

Superfluous ki points vanish at the end of a short or long rest.
