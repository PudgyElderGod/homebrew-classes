## Dash of Legends
At 9th level, when you take the Dash action, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling if you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield. This effect persists until the end of your next turn. This effect also ends when you attack, cast a spell, or take damage.
