## Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, you gain blindsense so long as you can hear or smell. You can treck through pitch darkness by using subtle smells or echoes in the air — much like a bat.

Your blindsense does not obsolete stealth or illusions, although it can aid you in discovering them. Blindsense can be obscured by liquids, walls (even glass windows), and an abundance or lack of smells and sounds, such as in a noisy, rancid tavern or somehow in outer space.
