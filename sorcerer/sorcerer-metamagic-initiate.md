## Metamagic Initiate
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs.
You can expend your sorcery points to use your Metamagic options.

You first unlock one unique Metamagic option, detailed in your chosen Sorcerous Origin.

When you reach 2nd level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain one of the following Metamagic options of your choice.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Careful Spell
***Cost: 1—3 points / creature***

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force.

To do so, you must spend 1 sorcery point for each creature that you want to protect.
A chosen creature has advantage on any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

You can instead spend 3 sorcery points per creature to completely mitigate any of the spell's direct effects against them until the start of your next turn.

### Distant Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than self, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase the range of the spell.

The spell's range either doubles or becomes 30ft, whichever is further.

### Suspended Spell
***Cost: 3 points***

When you cast a spell, you can spend 3 sorcery points to suspend the spell midair.
The spell becomes trapped in an orb of energy, which requires your concentration to maintain — as if you were casting a spell.

While you concentrate, you can use a bonus action to move the orb in any direction up to the spell's casting range, and activate it if you desire.
If the spell's range is self or touch, it cannot move.

When you activate the suspended orb, it breaks, and its stored spell immediately takes effect in its place, as if you cast the stored spell in that instant.

If you lose concentration or if the orb is outside your field of view when your turn begins, the orb is activated.

### Efficient Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that requires costly material components, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to overcharge your arcane energies and reduce the minimum required costs of those components by half.

### Elemental Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change its damage type to another one of those listed.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Empowered Spell
***Cost: 2 points***

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll any number of the damage dice; but you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration.

In addition, you have advantage on any concentration checks made to maintain this spell.

### Flection Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to bend the spell around corners.
When you do this, you can target creatures around such obstacles.

If a creature targeted by this spell has left your field of vision before the end of your last turn, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls that this spell might require.

### Focused Spell
***Cost: 2 points***

When you cast a spell that requires one or more attack rolls, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on those rolls until the start of your next turn.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Heightened Spell
***Cost: 3—5 points / creature***

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can intensify the spell's full force on some of those creatures.

To do so, you must spend 3 sorcery points for each selected creature that you want to affect.
A chosen creature has disadvantage on any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

You can instead spend 5 sorcery points per selected creature to make them automatically fail any saving throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

### Instinctive Spell
***Cost: variable***

You can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to cast any spell on the sorcerer spell list — even if you haven't learned the spell.

As normal, you must spend the associated level spell slot when you cast the spell.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Quickened Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.

### Subtle Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

You can use Subtle Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Twinned Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate cast the spell a second time simultaneously.

If a creature would be effected by both castings of this spell, it is instead only effected by one of them.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
