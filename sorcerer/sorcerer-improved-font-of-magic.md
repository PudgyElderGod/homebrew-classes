## Improved Font of Magic
Starting at 19th level, you can use your Font of Magic ability to convert sorcery points into spell slots of 6th level and higher.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-

- removes the level 5 cap for font of magic

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- it allows sorcerer to cast more than one level 9 spell a day
- but it is easier to convert down than convert up, casting level 9 spells is expensive
