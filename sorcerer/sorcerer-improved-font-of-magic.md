## Improved Font of Magic
By 20th level, you can wield your inner power with absolute control.
You can freely use your Font of Magic feature to convert spell slots into sorcery points and vice-versa (no action required).
Furthermore, when you convert spell slots into sorcery points, you gain a number of sorcery points equal to their conversion rate, without subtracting one.
Finally, you can convert sorcery points into spell slots of any level, including those above 5th level.
