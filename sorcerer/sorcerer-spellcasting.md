## Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic.
This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma Modifier when setting the Saving Throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

`Spell save DC = 9 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma Modifier`

`Spell Attack Modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma Modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells.
If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows how many sorcerer spells you know, and how many you learn when you level up.
You must choose these spells from the sorcerer spell list.
Each of these spells must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Sorcerer table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Sorcerer table.

### Preparing Spells
The sorcerer spells that you know are always considered prepared to cast.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.
