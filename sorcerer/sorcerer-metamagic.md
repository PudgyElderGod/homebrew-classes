## Metamagic
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs.
You can expend your sorcery points to use your Metamagic options.

You first unlock one unique Metamagic option, detailed in your chosen Sorcerous Origin.

When you reach 2nd level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain one of the following Metamagic options of your choice.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
