### Quickened Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
