### Careful Spell
***Cost: 1â€”3 points / creature***

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a Saving Throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force.

To do so, you must spend 1 sorcery point for each creature that you want to protect.
A chosen creature has advantage on any Saving Throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.

You can instead spend 3 sorcery points per creature to completely mitigate any of the spell's direct effects against them until the start of your next turn.
