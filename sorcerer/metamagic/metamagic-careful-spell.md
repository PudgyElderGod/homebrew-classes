### Careful Spell
- **Cost:** 1 point / creature

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a Saving Throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force.

To do so, you must spend 1 sorcery points for each creature that you want to protect.
A chosen creature automatically succeeds on any Saving Throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.
