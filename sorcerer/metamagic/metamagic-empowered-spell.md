### Empowered Spell
- **Cost:** 2 points

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll any number of the damage dice, but you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
