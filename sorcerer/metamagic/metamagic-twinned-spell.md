### Twinned Spell
- **Cost:** variable

When you cast a spell, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate cast the spell a second time simultaneously.

If a creature would be affected by both castings of this spell, it is instead only effected by one of them.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
