### Elemental Spell
***Cost: variable***

When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to change its damage type to another one of those listed.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
