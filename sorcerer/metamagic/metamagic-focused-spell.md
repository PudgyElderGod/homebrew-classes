### Focused Spell
***Cost: 2 points***

When you cast a spell that requires one or more Attack Rolls, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on those rolls until the start of your next turn.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
