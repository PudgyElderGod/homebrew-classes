### Suspended Spell
***Cost: 3 points***

When you cast a spell, you can spend 3 sorcery points to suspend the spell midair.
The spell becomes trapped in an orb of energy, which requires your concentration to maintain â€” as if you were casting a spell.

While you concentrate, you can use a bonus action to move the orb in any direction up to the spell's casting range, and activate it if you desire.
If the spell's range is self or touch, it cannot move.

When you activate the suspended orb, it breaks, and its stored spell immediately takes effect in its place, as if you cast the stored spell in that instant.

If you lose concentration or if the orb is outside your field of view when your turn begins, the orb is activated.
