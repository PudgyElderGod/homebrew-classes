### Instinctive Spell
***Cost: variable***

You can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to cast any spell on the sorcerer spell list â€” even if you haven't learned the spell.

As normal, you must spend the associated level spell slot when you cast the spell.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
