### Heightened Spell
- **Cost:** 3 points / creature

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a Saving Throw to resist its effects, you can intensify the spell's full force on some of those creatures.

To do so, you must spend 3 sorcery points for each selected creature that you want to affect.
A chosen creature has disadvantage on any Saving Throws directly induced by the spell until the start of your next turn.
