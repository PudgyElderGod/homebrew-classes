### Flection Spell
- **Cost:** 1 point

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to bend the spell around corners.
When you do this, you can target creatures heavily obscured by such solid obstacles.
The spell must follow a clear path to the target, although that path can make turns around solid objects and fit through *small* holes.
