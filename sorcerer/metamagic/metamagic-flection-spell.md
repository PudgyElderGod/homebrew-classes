### Flection Spell
***Cost: 1 point***

When you cast a spell that has a casting range that is greater than touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to bend the spell around corners.
When you do this, you can target creatures around such obstacles.

If a creature targeted by this spell has left your field of vision before the end of your last turn, you have disadvantage on any Attack Rolls that this spell might require.
