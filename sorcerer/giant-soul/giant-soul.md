# Giant Soul (UA)
The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm.
In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken.
During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power.
These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria.
Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse.
Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.

When you cast a spell that cannot deal direct damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make all sensory aspects of the spell invisible, innaudible, and otherwise unnoticeable.

You can use Cloudborn Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

Throughout this duration, you are able to use an action to break out of this effect early.

### Stormborn Spell
***Prerequisite: Storm Giant Soul***

If you use the *Soul of Lost Ostoria* feature while under its effects, its enlagement features are cumulative.
You can now have up to two instances of that feature active at once.

In addition, the *Soul of Lost Ostoria* feature and the *Enlarge* spell can now be used as a bonus action in place of an action.

## Blessing of the All-Father
By 18th level, you gain the favor and audience of Annam—the All-Father himself—be it physically, through a dream, or via some otherworldly experience.
At the DM's discretion, you are bequeathed one permanent blessing. *(DMG 227)*

While you cannot explicitly choose the exact blessing or epic boon that you recieve, you can most certainly negotiate the nature of your newfound power.

___

#### Enlarge
*2nd-level transmutation*
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V S M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause a creature or an object that you touch to grow larger for the duration.
Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried.
If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it.
Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
The creature gains the following effects:

- The target's size category increases by one
- The target's size doubles in all dimensions
- The target's mass & weight are multiplied by 8

If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, it either shatters the environment around it, breaks itself, or becomes restrained.
