## Font of Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.
This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

### Sorcery Points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain additional sorcery points every time you level up, as shown on the Sorcerer Table.
You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

You can expend your sorcery points to create spell slots and vice-versa.
You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
Refer to the Sorcery Points Table in the sections that call for a spell slot's sorcery point conversion rate.

### Universal Energy
Sorcery points are a variant of spell points.
They can be used with other features that utilize spell points.
Likewise, other sources of spell points can fuel Sorcerer features that call for sorcery points.

### Converting Sorcery Points
You can transform unexpended sorcery points into spell slots as a bonus action on your turn.
For each spell slot that you want to make, spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell slot's sorcery point conversion rate, as shown in the Sorcery Points Table.
You can use this feature to create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

### Converting Spell Slots
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of spell slots to generate sorcery points.
For each spell slot spent in this way, you gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell slot's sorcery point conversion rate minus one, as shown in the Sorcery Points Table.

Superfluous sorcery points vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- added conversion rates for spells of higher in level than 5th
- increased payout for converting spell slots to sorcery points
- you can now convert multiple spell slots at once
- you can now generate multiple spell slots at once
- but you can't do both at once
- increased pool of sorcery points to twice your level

-<< TODO >>-
- reword confusing rules

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the sorcery point tax was too high in vanilla, so it was lowered.
- low-level spells experience a higher tax than high-level spell slots.
- thus, creating low-level spell slots from a high level spell slot is easy.
- creating a high-level spell slot from many low level spell-slots is hard.
