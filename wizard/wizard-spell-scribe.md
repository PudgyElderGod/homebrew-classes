## Spell Scribe
Using your knowledge of the arcane, you can create spell scrolls from the repository of spells that you can cast.

Before the process can begin, you must spend 1 hour and 15 sp in equipment to prepare the scroll to receive a spell.
For every level of the spell that you chose, the number of hours that the process takes increases by 2, and the price increases by 35 sp.

Afterwards, you cast the spell into the scroll.
Once you do so, make a Intelligence Saving Throw equal to `9 + the spell's level + the expended spell slot's level`.
If you fail this Saving Throw, the spell immediately takes effect centered on you.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll, it automatically hits you.
If the spell requires a Saving Throw, you automatically fail the save.
Otherwise, the spell scroll is completed, and you can put it into your inventory.
