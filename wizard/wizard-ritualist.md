## Ritualist
By 2nd level, you have studied the arts of magic extensively, and have become adept at following spell recipes without having to memorize them. You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You no longer need to have the spell prepared.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved ritual spells of this nature to 2nd level from 1st
- created a special feature for it
-> this is a new feature
-> no longer is it located buried in spellcasting rules for wizard

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- main reason is that wizard at level 1 already gets a huge access to spells
-> they can learn every 1st-level wizard spell and cantrip with their spellbook
-> they can prepare any combination of those spells as they see fit
-> they prepare an absurd number of spells, and already cast them as rituals
- this emphasizes level 2 as a sort of breakpoint
-> in this way, level 2 tries to emulate the power that level 2 fighter gives
