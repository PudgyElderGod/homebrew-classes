## Invent Cantrip
By 8th level, you have enough experience with the arcane that you have uncovered a unique cantrip of your own creation.
Once you invent this cantrip, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
The cantrip is a wizard spell, although other classes may have access to it as well (at the DM's discretion).

Work with your DM to come up with the rules for your special cantrip.
Because cantrips are at-will abilities, you and your DM must be careful of its balance.

If you prefer, you may choose a pre-existing cantrip to re-invent instead.
