## Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence Modifier when setting the Saving Throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

`Spell Save DC = 9 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier`

`Spell Attack Modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier`

### Spell Slots
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
The Wizard Table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells.
If you cast a cantrip, or 0th level spell, you don't need to expend a spell slot unless you cast it at a higher level.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing ten wizard spells of your choice.
Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know.

### Learning Spells
Each time you gain a Wizard Level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook.
Each of these spells must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard Table.
On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your spellbook.
Your spellcasting ability will influence the maximum number of spells you can prepare.
Each spell must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard Table.

`Max. prepared spells = your Wizard Level + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier`

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

> ## Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.
> You might find other spells during your adventures.
> You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
>
> ### Copying a Spell into the Book
> When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it.
> You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> The process takes 1 hour and costs 15 sp.
> For each level of the spell, the process takes an additional 2 hours and costs an additional 35 sp.
> The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
> Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ### Replacing the Book
> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &mdash; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook.
> This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.
> You need spend only 1 hour and 10 sp for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
> Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.
> For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ### The Book's Appearance
> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.
> It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
