## Magical Tutor
By 8th level, you have gathered enough knowledge to properly instruct those eager enough to learn about the arcane.
You can now instruct classes on the arcane when you have the time.

Your class takes `60 sessions รท your Intelligence Modifier` for a student to complete.
A session normally lasts two hours, and can be held once per day.
You have enough mental prowess to hold the attention of a number of students equal to `your Wizard Level` for one session.
Typically, you can only host a fully attended class if you do so in an urban environment.

You can get paid for your endeavor if you have enough students.
After you complete a full course, you are paid `5 gp` times the number of students that completed your course.
During this time, you do not have to pay for living costs, and can live a comfortable lifestyle free of charge.

Right now, I'm not so happy about this ability as I could be.
It seems thematic enough, its just, this has too much math!
