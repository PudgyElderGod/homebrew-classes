## Magical Tutor
By 8th level, you have gathered enough knowledge to properly instruct those eager enough to learn about the arcane when you have the time to do so.

Your class takes 30 three-hour sessions for a student to complete.
You have enough mental prowess to hold the attention of a number of students equal to `your Wizard Level + your Intelligence Modifier` for one session.
Although a student can attend only one session per day, you may be able to host multiple courses to cater to more students.
Typically, you can host a fully attended class only if you do so in an urban environment, and only if you target students who have never dabbled in the arcane before.

You can get paid for your endeavor if you have enough students.
After you instruct a full term of courses, you can be paid `1 gp` per student that completed your course.

When you are teaching a class, you do not have to pay for living costs, and can live a comfortable lifestyle free of charge.

Right now, I'm not so happy about this ability as I could be.
It seems thematic enough, its just, this has too much math!
