## Spell Mastery
At 10th level, you have achieved such mastery over your low-level spells that you can cast them at will.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can memorize up to one wizard spell that is in your spellbook.
Once you have a spell memorized, it counts as a cantrip for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
You can only memorize 1st-level spells in this way.

You can exchange a spell that you have memorized in this way for another by spending an additional 8 hours in study.

Once you reach 18th level, you can memorize up to two wizard spells that are in your spellbook.
One of these spells can be of 2nd-level.
