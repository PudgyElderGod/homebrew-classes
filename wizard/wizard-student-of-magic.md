## Student of Magic
At 8th level, you can inscribe several magical cantrips from your studies into your spell book.
When you gain this feature, choose four cantrips from any class's spell list (the four needn't be from the same list).
While your spell book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will.
They don't count against the number of spells you can prepare.
If they don't appear on the wizard spell list, they are nonetheless wizard spells for you.
