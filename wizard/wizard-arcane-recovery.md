## Arcane Recovery
Starting at 1st level, you have gained the knowledge to pull power from the weave around you.

You have 1 arcana point, and you gain additional arcana points every time you level up, as shown on the Wizard Table.
You regain all spend arcana points when you finish a long rest.

### Universal Energy
If you have the Font of Magic or Ki Channeler feature, you can use arcana points with those features as if they were sorcery points or ki points, respectively.

### Converting Arcana Points
You can transform unexpended arcana points into spell slots at the end of a short or long rest.
For each spell slot that you want to make, spend a number of arcana points equal to its arcana point conversion rate, as shown in the Arcana Points Table.
You can use this feature to create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved from 2nd level to 1st
- gutted main ability, kept concept.
- copied font of magic

-<< TODO >>-
- ensure balance; playtest

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- compared to the original ability:
-> this is more powerful, more versatile.
-> you can still generate 1 first-level spell at 2nd level.
-> you can still generate 10 first-level spells by 20th level.
-> you can, however, generate more high-level spells.
