## Arcane Recovery
By 19th level you have gained the power to absorb the mana in the air around you.
You have 20 arcana points.
You regain all spent arcana points when you finish a long rest.

You can transform unexpended arcana points into spell slots at the end of a short or long rest.
For each spell slot that you want to make, spend a number of arcana points equal to its arcana point conversion rate, as shown in the Arcana Points Table.
You can use this feature to create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Superfluous spell slots vanish at the end of a short or long rest.

#### Arcana Points

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved from 2nd level to 19th
- gutted main ability, kept concept.
- copied font of magic

-<< TODO >>-
- ensure balance; playtest

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- compared to the original ability:
-> this is more powerful, but online way late.
-> you can still generate 10 first-level spells.
-> you can, however, generate more high-level spells.
-> instead of creating 3 thirds, you can make 4 thirds.
-> you also have extra leftover when you make more fifths.
