## Arcane Recovery
By 19th level you have gained the power to absorb the mana in the air around you.
You now regain all expended 1st-level spell slots at the end of a short or long rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- moved from 2nd level to 19th
- greatly improved power of ability
- all 1st-level spells are now totally expendable

-<< TODO >>-
- ensure balance; playtest

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- the idea is that 1st-level spells are valuable, but expendable
- this allows high level spell slots to be used for high level spells easily
- this allows the rapid consumption of 1st-level spell slots and upcasted cantrips
