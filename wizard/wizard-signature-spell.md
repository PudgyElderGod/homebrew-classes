## Signature Spell
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over a powerful spell and can cast it with little effort.
Choose one 3rd-level wizard spell in your spellbook as your signature spell.
You always have this spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

You also get three magic charges for use with this spell.
When you cast this spell, you can expend a magic charge.
If you do so, the spell counts as a cantrip for this casting, and you don't have to expend a spell slot.
You can choose to upcast it as normal if that option is available.
You regain these magic charges when you finish a short or long rest.

<!--

-<< CHANGES >>-
- renamed from signature spells to signature spell
- 3 charges for 1 spell instead of 2 charges for 2
- makes it a cantrip for the casting instead

-<< TODO >>-
- none

-<< COMMENTARY >>-
- notice the cantrip instead of simply being free
-> allows more rules with it (damn though!)
-> this makes upcasting it to ridiculous levels possible
-> for example, level 3 fireball cantrip (0+3) 11d6 â‰ˆ level 6 fireball (3+3) 11d6
-> for example, you can cast fireball at the equivalent of twelfth level (17d6)
- gives more power for less versatility (1 spell instead of 2)
- tally less resources (tracking 1 on 2 vs 3 for 1)
